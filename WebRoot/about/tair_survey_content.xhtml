		<span class="mainheader"> TAIR Survey Results</span>
		<p>
			The 2009/2010 TAIR Community survey polled the non-commercial TAIR
			user community to find out how well the TAIR web site is serving the
			needs of that community of users. It also surveyed the opinions of
			the community on approaches related to the sustaining of TAIR access
			and data over time. The survey itself is an online survey that TAIR
			built on the surveymonkey.com web site. Half the responses were
			obtained by emailing a random set of registered TAIR users and the
			other half were obtained via a link to the survey on TAIR pages.
