        <p>
            Dear TAIR supporter,
        </p>
        <p>
            As you may have heard, after ten years of grant support from the National Science Foundation, funding for the
            Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) is to be phased out over the next three years (
            <a href="/doc/about/tair_funding/410">http://www.arabidopsis.org/doc/about/tair_funding/410</a>).
            This resource, which is used by 38,000 scientists, teachers and students worldwide every month, is critically
            important to plant scientists in both the public and private sectors and must be maintained.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to continue providing this essential service, we are establishing a new corporate sponsorship program to help
            support TAIR. We strongly feel that such a sponsorship program is preferable to implementing a subscription
            requirement for the private sector because it will allow us to keep TAIR open and free of login requirements,
            facilitating the free exploration of data by all scientists.
        </p>
        <p>
            Several annual sponsorship opportunities will be available to corporations interested in helping us sustain open
            access to the TAIR database:

            The name and logo of participating companies will be displayed on a new &lsquo;TAIR Sponsors&rsquo; web page and a
            TAIR Sponsorship logo (see samples above) will be made available for display on the company website. For sponsors who
            are interested in learning more about TAIR, we will offer training opportunities including hosting company scientists
            at TAIR for several days or a TAIR workshop conducted by our staff at your company (any travel costs to be borne by
            the company).
        </p>
        <p>
            We hope that you will join us in keeping this essential resource available to plant scientists in both the public and
            private sectors. If your company is in a position to participate in the TAIR sponsorship program at any of the levels
            cited above, please send a check made out to &lsquo;Carnegie Institution&rsquo; in the amount of your gift and a short
            note indicating that the gift is for TAIR to:
