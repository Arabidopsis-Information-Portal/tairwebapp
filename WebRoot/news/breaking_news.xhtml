                        <p>There will be a fee increase for stocks and

                            in accordance to our Business Plan submitted to NSF.
                            Due to the reduction in funding, this is the second
                            of two increases necessary to sustain our current

                            current funding period from 2012-2016 . The new
                            charge for most individual stocks will be $10 each,
                            and the order charge will be $20 for domestic and
                            $25 for international orders. We will continue to
                            work on becoming more efficient and perhaps offer
                            more services in the future. Thank you for your help

                            of filters were applied: 1) alignment segments with

                            the match with the best overall% were retained, 4)

                            version of the Arabidopsis genome annotation
                            (TAIR10). The latest release builds upon the gene
                            structures of the previous TAIR9 release using
                            RNA-seq and proteomics datasets as well as manual
                            updates informed by cross species alignments,
                            peptides and community input regarding missing and
                            incorrectly annotated genes. <br /> <br /> The
                            TAIR10 release contains 27,416 protein coding genes,
                            4827 pseudogenes or transposable element genes and
                            1359 ncRNAs (33,602 genes in all, 41,671 gene
                            models). A total of 126 new loci and 2099 new gene
                            models were added. <br /> <br /> Eighteen percent
                            (5885) of Arabidopsis genes now have annotated
                            splice variants. Updates were made to 1184 gene
                            models of which 707 had CDS updates. There were 41
                            gene splits and 37 gene merges. No changes were made
                            to the Arabidopsis genome assembly for the TAIR10
                            release. <br /> <br /> Gene annotation utilized
                            available proteomics data (Baerenfaller et al., 2008
                            and Castellana et al., 2008) and RNA-seq data from
                            the Ecker and Mockler labs (Lister et al. 2008,
                            Filichkin et al. 2010). RNA-seq data was mapped to
                            the Arabidopsis genome using TopHat, HashMatch or
                            supersplat. After quality and low complexity
                            filtering a total of ~200 million RNA-seq reads were
                            successfully mapped to the genome. Of these, ~9
                            million represent spliced reads. Proteomics data and
                            spliced RNA-seq reads were provided to Augustus and
                            the resulting gene models categorised and manually
                            reviewed. Validated gene updates, novel genes and
                            novel splice variants were incorporated into the
                            TAIR10 release. Additional spliced RNA-seq reads not
                            already incorporated into gene models by Augustus
                            were supplied to TAU. The resulting TAU models were
                            again reviewed for potential novel splice variants.
                            Transcript assemblies were generated via Cufflinks
                            using all spliced reads and unspliced reads from the
                            Ecker sets. Transcript assemblies were filtered and
                            compared to existing gene models, resulting in the
                            addition of 56 novel genes. Additional new proteome
                            data provided to us by Katja Baerenfaller was used
                            to directly update 24 gene models. <br /> <br />
                            Gene models created using the Gnomon pipeline were
                            provided to TAIR by NCBI. Reanalysis of these models
                            for TAIR10 resulted in 11 additional novel genes, 67
                            additional alternative splice variants and 164
                            updates to existing genes. <br /> <br /> We would
                            like to thank all those who contributed to the
                            latest release by providing submissions for new and
