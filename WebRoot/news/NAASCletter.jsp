Dear Researcher,

The Arabidopsis 2010 Project was initiated in 2001 with the goal 
of determining the function of all genes in Arabidopsis.
2005 marks the midpoint of the 2010 Project 
and the North American Arabidopsis Steering Committee (NAASC)
is seeking broad community input for a midpoint assessment.

Please complete the following <a href="http://surveymonkey.com/s.asp?u=453451176745">survey </a> 
and help provide feedback that will be used to evaluate the past 
and future activities of the 2010 Project supported by the National Science Foundation.
