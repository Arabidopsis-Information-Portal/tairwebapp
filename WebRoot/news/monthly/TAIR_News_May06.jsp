<h2 class="header">TAIR April/May 2006 News Release</h2>	

The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR, http://arabidopsis.org) emails our registered users regular news releases about new or updated data and tools at TAIR:
<P>

For the months of April and May 2006:

<p>
1. <a href="http://arabidopsis.org/portals/index.jsp">New Portal Pages</a><br />

In response to community suggestions, TAIR has created several portal 
pages that combine information, datasets, and tools relevant to specific 
areas of interest, such as DNA Resources, Gene Expression, Mutant and 
Mapping Resources, Genome Annotation, and Proteome Resources. Within each 
portal, hyperlinks are provided to common resources either found at TAIR 
or elsewhere in the cyberworld. The portal pages serve as gateways for our 
users to find relevant information easily.

<p>
2. TAIR workshops at the Madison Arabidopsis Annual Meeting<br />

In the upcoming <a href="http://www.union.wisc.edu/arabidopsis/">Arabidopsis meeting</a>,
TAIR will hold two concurrent 
workshops, at 7:30 pm on Thursday, June 29. (1) The TAIR introductory 
workshop will be a great opportunity for new and existing TAIR users to 
become efficient in finding information and using tools provided on the 
TAIR web site, such as finding gene functional annotations using the 
Keyword browser, searching and ordering stocks, using the genome browser 
SeqViewer and the AraCyc biochemical pathways tool. (2) The data 
submission workshop will provide detailed instructions and guidelines for 
the 2010 grant recipients and all researchers on submitting data and 
biological materials to long-term repositories including TAIR, ABRC, NASC, 
NCBI and EBI.

<p>
3. First Gene Ontology Newsletter<br />

TAIR has been part of the Gene Ontology Consortium since 2000 and uses the 
vocabularies developed by the GOC for annotation of gene product function, 
biological process and subcellular localization.  The first issue of the 
GO Newsletter is now available online at 
http://www.geneontology.org/newsletter/current-newsletter.shtml.
The AmiGO mini-tutorial in the issue may be of particular interest to the 
Arabidopsis community.
