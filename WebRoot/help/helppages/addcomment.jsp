<a name="addcom1"></a><h2>Adding and Viewing comments on TAIR detail pages</h2>
<p>
<a name="addcom2"></a><font class ="cont">You can add your comments and insights directly to TAIR and share information  with other TAIR users. This feature is included on all data object detail pages (e.g. Locus, Gene, Clone, Polymorphism, etc...). The purpose is to facilitate information exchange among researchers. For example, if a researcher reads a gene detail page and notices that the structural annotation is incorrect you can simply add that information as a comment (e.g. missing intron at nt 236-312). Curators will periodically review the comments and incorporate needed changes (such as updating the structural annotation of a gene) to the database.To add comments you must be registered with TAIR. For help with registering see <a href="commreg.jsp">Registration Help</a></font>
<p>
<a name="addcom5"></a><h4>Viewing comments</h4>
<p>
<a name="addcom8"></a><font class="cont">If there are comments associated to the data on the detail page the author name, date and first 100 characters of the comment will be displayed. Clicking on the comment text will display a window with the entire text of the comment. The author's name is hyperlinked to the community detail page for that person. By default, only the most recent comments will be displayed. To view any older comments, click on the Show All button. If you would prefer not to see any comments, click on the Hide Comments button.</font>
