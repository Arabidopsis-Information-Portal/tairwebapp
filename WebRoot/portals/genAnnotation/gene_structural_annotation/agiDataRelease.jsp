<p>
Response from Satoshi Tabata (<a href=MAILTO:tabata@kazusa.or.jp>tabata@kazusa.or.jp</a>)
<p>
A.  We are currently sequencing portions of chomosome 5.
<p>
B.  We will be releasing the finished sequences with full
annotation within six months after sequencing began.
<p>
C.
1) We believe that the finished accurate sequence is most useful
to users after all, though we recognize some usefulness of
unassembled random sequence data for marker construction and gene
finding.
<p>
 2) We do not like the sequencing process to be complicated by
putting an additional task in it, because we need to control the
whole process of large-scale sequencing very carefully to achieve
maximum performance.
<p>
 3) Consistent and informative annotation would undoubtedly be very
useful to users, and this process delays the data release for only
two to three weeks.
<p>
D.  No changes anticipated.  By improving the sequencing and
annotation system, the data release will be within four to six
months after the start of sequencing.
<p>
E.  The release will be in the middle of July, as I mentioned at
the Arabidopsis meeting.
<p>
F.  No.  We just began preparaion for the second release that will
be on September 1st.
<p>
G.  KAOS (Kazusa Arabidopsis data Opening Site) at:
<dd><a href = http://www.kazusa.or.jp/arabi/>http://www.kazusa.or.jp/arabi/</a>
<p>
H.  Genome sequencing projects, especially of higher eukaryotes,
are long-term projects, and one needs to have enough time for
preparation to reach the final goal most quickly and efficiently.
In our case, pilot sequencing started in February 1996 and is
still under improvement. We started development of automatic
annotation  system in September 1996, and it is not completed yet.
I am expecting that we will be able to produce up to 800 kb per
month by the end of this year, but both sequencing and annotation
systems have to be completed for this preformance.  We are very
happy feeling that people in the community are placing great
expectation on us, and we would sincerely like to come up to it.
So, please give us time and be tolerant a bit.  Please !!

<b><a name="EU">II.  EUROPEAN SEQUENCING PROGRAM</b>
<p>
Response from Michael Bevan (<a href=MAILTO:michael.bevan@bbsrc.ac.uk>michael.bevan@bbsrc.ac.uk</a>)
<p>
A.  The EU network sequences on the bottom arm of chromosome 4 and
provides contig information to the CSHSQ on the top arms of
chromosomes 4 and 5.
<p>
B.  Our policy conforms to that agreed in the Memorandum of
Understanding.  We make available to the public sequence that aims
to be of the following standard: It is sequenced on both strands
with a mixture of chemistries wherever possible. Regions in which
it is difficult to obtain sequence on both strands MAY, after some
additional effort, be publically released as an initial version
with a "health warning".  The predicted restriction map must
agree, within the limits of accuracy, to the restriction
fingerprint of the clone (which is anchored to the chromosome),
and overlaps with adjacent clones must be checked and sequence
differences identified and resolved.  We are also using BAC end
sequencing for overlap verifications.  Initially the sequence may
not be annotated using our standard protocols, but we aim to
accomplish this within one month of public release.  The regions
sequenced as part of the first stage of the EU sequencing project
were being carried out before the advent of the AGI Agreement.  It
was decided to maintain our focus on releasing a single contig of
sequence for the main region, rather than to release the sequence
of unanchored cosmid clones which were all in different states of
preparedness and of unverified accuracy.  This region was sent as
ten 200 kb units to EMBL in early June, and these have the
following accession numbers: Z97335 - Z97344 inclusive.
<p>
We have deviated from the AGI Agreement in one important respect,
which requires clarification.  The EU network originally agreed to
number the predicted genes in order from an (arbitary) end of the
clone.  For the 1.9 Mb contig this proved to be a poor solution
for a variety of reasons, so we have numbered the predicted genes
in their known order within the contig, and in their predicted
order from the centromere.  It is 2.3 Mb from the distal copy of
the pericentromeric repeats to the proximal extent of the
published contig.  We calculated this region contains about 500
genes, and our coordinates allow for a slop of 5 genes per unit
(for different versions) plus another 100 genes, therefore our
numbering within the contig starts at 3000, with each gene having
coordinates of 3000, 3005, 3010 etc, and different versions being
eg 3006, 3007 for different versions of 3005. The overall aim of
this is to try to develop a chromosome-based system from an early
stage. Useful comments are welcome. The AP2 region, a 450 kb
contig around that gene, will soon be released when annotation is
completed, hopefully within 4 weeks.
<p>
As has always been the case, anyone with a particular interest in
these regions has always been helped (by providing sequence for
example) to the best of our ability. The BACs sequenced in the
second stage of EU sequencing that are complete, but not yet
annotated, will be available from the MIPS website (see below) as
soon as they are completed.  There are 8 of these presently being
annotated. Due to the unexpected anxiety caused by the public not
being able to see these sequences before annotation, we have
brought forward our release schedule for these clones and will
maintain this release policy in the future.  Next year we aim to
release daily production sequence from some of the larger labs in
the EU network.
<p>
C.  The EU release policy, seen above, is an amalgamation of often
conflicting requirements. We have to balance the requirements of
the EC, who wish the sequence to benefit relevant sectors of
industry (worldwide), with the normal scientific practice of
releasing data of the highest possible standards (with available
technology) and of the greatest utility, with the requirement of
the public for immediate access, for a wide variety of reasons.
We have worked hard to deal with these requirements and have what
we hope is a satisfactory solution, at least for the present.
<p>
D.  This policy will be revised from time to time, according to
new developments.
<p>
E.  The EU network is presently sequencing and analysing 46 BACs
and P1s.  8 are completed according to the criteria described
above.  About 16 clones are in a "prefinal" state, ie they have
between 1-10 physical gaps and are not completely double-stranded.
A further 4 clones, distributed early in the project, present
difficulties with respect to repeat regions that require
individual attention.  These will probably not be completed and
available for some time.
<p>
F.  It is difficult to predict the time of release of individual
clones. Some clones are complete except for difficult-to-sequence
regions, and we cannot predict when (if ever) these will be
completed to the standards described above.  We will do our best
to complete these areas to high standards.  These regions are, of
course, often the most interesting, and subsequent analysis
requires highly accurate sequence.
<p>
G.  The internet addresses for EU sequence and analysis is:
<dd><a href=http://mips.gsf.de/proj/thal/db/index.html>http://mips.gsf.de/proj/thal/db/index.html</a>
<p>
Here one can see the sequence of the FCA contig presented as a
graphical output, with predicted genes as clickable objects
leading to a database of homologies. In addition, an Arabidopsis
protein sequence and structure database, also with similarity
searches using Smith-Waterman methods, is available at:
<dd><a href=http://pedant.gsf.de/>
http://pedant.gsf.de/</a><p>
Annotated sequence, in its chromosomal context, will soon be
available from: <dd><a href=>http://synteny.nott.ac.uk/arabidopsis.html</a><p>
in a more familiar ACeDB format, in addition to the usual embl
format. These databases will undergo continual improvements both
in the amount and type of data collected, as well as in the query
tools to use, and detail of analysis. The ultimate goal of the EU
plant database community is to link Arabidopsis genome sequence
with that of crop plant species and with function search
activities in the EU.
<p>
H.  Scientists might like to begin to consider the type and degree
of annotation they expect from the sequencing community, and how
soon they expect to see reasonably sized contigs, precisely
anchored in a chromosomal context. Finally, they might like to
think about the type of databases that best suit their work, and
ensure that these are supported.

<p>
A.  End sequence of BAC clones from the IGF and TAMU library in
collaboration with TIGR.
<p>
B.  Release of the data as soon as possible.  The delay is caused
only by the time needed to process the data.

<b><a name="ATGC">IV.  SPP CONSORTIUM (U PENN COMPONENT)</b>
<p>
Response from Joe Ecker (<a href=MAILTO:jecker@atgenome.bio.upenn.edu>jecker@atgenome.bio.upenn.edu</a>)
<p>
A.  The responsibilities of the PENN group of the SPP consortium
are: (1) to prepare a tiling path of overlapping BAC clones for
5.2 megabases of chromosome 1; (2) to determine the end sequences
of chromosome 1 BAC clones; (3) to provide the complete finished
and annotated sequences for a minimum of 5.2 Mb of chromosome 1 by
1999 (with the Stanford and PGEC groups).
<p>
B.  The PENN group policy for release is immediate release of the
shotgun phase and finished sequences into to Genbank.  For more
details see the SPP DATA RELEASE POLICY at:
<dd><a href=>http://pgec-genome.pw.usda.gov/scope.html</a>
<p>
C.  We have always felt that this policy best meets the desires of
the community of Arabidopsis researchers.
<p>
As indicated by a show of hands at the 1997 Arabidopsis meeting in
Madison WI, a clear majority of researchers agree with this
policy.  By my count, there were only two individuals out of 600
or so in the audience that felt immediate release of data was not
a good policy.

<b><a name="TIGR">VII.  TIGR SEQUENCING PROGRAM</b>
<p>
Response from Steve Rounsley (<a href=MAILTO:rounsley@tigr.org>rounsley@tigr.org</a>)
<p>
A.  TIGR is participating in the AGI by sequencing (via the
shotgun sequencing method) and annotating BAC clones from
chromosome II.  In addition to this, we are generating BAC end
sequences from the entire TAMU and IGF libraries in collaboration
with the Centre National de Sequencage in France.
<p>
B.  After generating shotgun sequences for a given BAC clone, an
assembly is performed and contigs longer than 2kb generated at
this stage are made publicly available.  Currently this is via our
ftp site, but we are working with NCBI to make them available in
the HTGS division of GenBank.  This will make them available for
searching via the BLAST server at NCBI.  After this initial
release, the process of closing gaps begins, followed by
annotation.  The annotated BAC sequence is submitted to NCBI and
appears in the Plant division of GenBank.
<p>
BAC end sequences are made available immediately after processing.
They are available on our ftp site, and on our web site.  The web
site offers a search capability with a graphical view of the
results.
<p>
C.  We believe the release of assembled contigs after the shotgun
sequencing is complete provides useful sequence data to the
community but also provides enough time to provide some quality
control over the data. However preliminary data is still just that
and should be treated with caution, as contig order and structure
can change during the finishing process.  We are still committed
to providing high quality annotation for the sequence when it is
complete.
<p>
D.  The only change that will occur in the foreseeable future is
to have the preliminary sequence available at NCBI.  This should
happen within the next month.  Until then, they are available on
the ftp site.
<p>
E.  The only sequence data that are not available are the shotgun
sequences themselves that accumulate during the sequencing phase.
Typically it takes less than a week to generate these sequences
and then the initial assembly is performed.  The contigs that
result from this assembly are made available.
<p>
F.  Future BAC sequences will be made available as outlined above.
<p>
G.  Annotated Sequence data is available on the web:
    <dd><a href=http://www.tigr.org/tdb/at/atgenome/atgenome.html>http://www.tigr.org/tdb/at/atgenome/atgenome.html</a><p>
<p>
    Current status of any given clone can be found at:
    <dd><a href=http://www.tigr.org/tdb/at/atgenome/at_bacs.html>http://www.tigr.org/tdb/at/atgenome/at_bacs.html</a><p>
<p>
    BAC end sequences can be searched at:
    <dd><a href=http://www.tigr.org/tdb/at/atgenome/bac_end_search/bac_end_search.html>http://www.tigr.org/tdb/at/atgenome/bac_end_search/bac_end_search.html</a><p>

<b><a name="CSH">VIII.  COLD SPRING HARBOR/WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY CONSORTIUM</b>
<p>
Response From Dick McCombie (<a href=MAILTO:mccombie@cshl.org>mccombie@cshl.org</a>)
<p>
A.  We are a consortium that is targetting the sequencing of the
short arm of chromosome IV and parts of chromosome V during the
period of fall 1996- fall 1999.  We proposed sequencing at least
6.5-7.0 megabases during this three year period.
<p>
B.  Our AGI data release policy is as follows:
<p>
    1)  All contigs over 1.5 kilobases will be released as they
are assembled from shotgun sequence data.  These contigs will be
available on ftp sites and BLAST servers accessible from our web
sites.  The sequence assemblies in our labs will be automatically
analysed and this new and updated contig data transferred to the
ftp and BLAST servers on a daily basis.
<p>
    2)  Finished, annotated sequence will be submitted to GenBank
as it is completed, with no intrinsic delay or data hold.
<p>
C.  The sequencing of the Arabidopsis genome is in large part a
public service to the community.  As such we believe that it is
important to make the data available as rapidly as possible to
that community.  By putting the sequences on our own ftp sites and
providing BLAST search capabilities at those sites we can,  and
do, provide daily updates of the projects in progress in our labs.
<p>
     We will continue to use GenBank as a repository for finished,
high quality, annotated sequence.  This is in fitting with the
role GenBank was created for and has historically served.
<p>
D.  No changes anticipated.
<p>
E.  We do not have substantial unreleased data.
<p>
F.  We will continue daily updates.
<p>
G.  For Cold Spring Harbor:

<p>
H.  We have been and continue to be committed to immediate data
release.  We welcome the acceptance of this principle by any other
AGI group that has not already done so.
