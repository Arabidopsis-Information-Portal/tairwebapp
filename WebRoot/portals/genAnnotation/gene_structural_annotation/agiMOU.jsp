<b>Multinational Effort to Sequence the
Arabidopsis Genome</b> (Sept. '96)

<p>

On August 20-21, 1996, representatives of six research groups
committed to sequencing the Arabidopsis genome met in Washington DC to
discuss strategies for facilitating international cooperation in
completing the genome project.  All six groups have secured major
funding to pursue large-scale genomic sequencing of Arabidopsis, and
the EU and Japanese groups have been engaged in large-scale sequencing
for some time.  The primary objectives of this meeting were to
establish Arabidopsis as a model for international coordination of
sequencing efforts and to develop guidelines for rapid and efficient
completion of the sequencing project by the year 2004.
Representatives from Japan, France, the EU, and the USA were present
at the meeting.  A complete list of participants and observers is
attached as Appendix I.
<p>
     A remarkable degree of consensus was reached by the end of the
meeting on the general strategy for the Arabidopsis sequencing
project.  All parties agreed to follow several practices that were
seen as facilitating international cooperation.  This document was
drafted to serve as a modus operandi for the participating groups
until such time as it is modified by mutual agreement of
representatives of the participating groups. All signatories to this
document have agreed to the following:
<p>
1. The Arabidopsis Genome Initiative (AGI) is intended to be an
inclusive international collaboration.  Any group that intends to
engage in the sequencing of hundreds of kilobases of contiguous
Arabidopsis genomic DNA will be invited to participate as a coequal
collaborator in the AGI and will be expected to follow the guidelines
outlined in this document.
<p>
2. A coordinating committee with representation from each of the
participating groups was formed.  This committee will be responsible
for making all decisions that affect the overall goals and operations
of the AGI.  In particular, it is anticipated that the AGI
coordinating committee will be a planning and brokering system for
establishing efficient ways of completing the genome.  The committee
will endeavor to apportion regions of the genome to the various groups
in such a way as to minimize needless duplication of effort while
maximizing progress toward complete sequencing of the genome.  The
committee will also be responsible for keeping the Arabidopsis
community informed of continuing advances in the sequencing project.
<p>
     Members of the committee for 1996-97 are Mike Bevan (Chair; EU
consortium), Satoshi Tabata (Kazusa DNA Research Institute), Joe Ecker
(Stanford-University of Pennsylvania-Plant Gene Expression Consortium
{the SPP consortium}), Dick McCombie (Cold Spring Harbor-Washington
University -Applied Biosystems Consortium {CSH-WU-ABI}), Steve
Rounsley (The Institute for Genomic Research {TIGR}), Francis Quertier
(French Genome Center) and David Meinke (Multinational Arabidopsis
Steering Committee).  Each member of the committee will be responsible
for arranging a temporary or permanent replacement from the
represented group when appropriate.  New members will be invited to
join the committee based on a nomination from one member of the
committee and an affirmative vote by a majority.  It is anticipated
that the committee will maintain regular communication and will meet
annually.  Mike Cherry (Curator of TAIR) will develop an email server
to facilitate correspondence between members of the committee.
<p>
3. The six research groups are expected to complete different amounts
of finished sequence because they have different capabilities and
levels of funding devoted to this project.  In order to prevent
duplication of effort, it was considered useful to have the various
groups initiate sequencing in different well-defined regions of the
genome.  It was agreed that each group should begin by nucleating
sites over a contiguous region of a size that could be completed with
the funding available.  It was recognized that it may not be possible
to define such a region with high accuracy because of variation in the
ratio of genetic distance to physical distance.  The goal in this
respect should be to avoid situations where one group obtains
scattered regions of sequence that must eventually be finished (i.e.,
linked up) by other groups.  Exceptions to this strategy are noted
elsewhere in this document.
<p>
     The SPP group will begin nucleating on chromosome 1. The EU group
will nucleate the bottom arm of chromosome 4. The CSH-WU- ABI group
will nucleate a 4 Mb region on the top arm of chromosome 4 and a 2 Mb
region on the top arm of chromosome 5 (the latter in collaboration
with the EU group and the Kazusa group).  The TIGR group will nucleate
chromosome 2.  The Kazusa group will nucleate the lower part of
chromosome 5. The region at the top of chromosome 5 of mutual interest
to the EU, CSH-WU-ABI and Kazusa group will be sequenced
collaboratively.  The Kazusa group, which anticipates a monthly
sequencing rate of approximately 500 Kb, expects to begin nucleating a
region of chromosome 3 in 1997.  The EU, TIGR, SPP and CSH-WU-ABI
groups anticipate an average monthly rate of approximately 200, 220,
150 and 150 Kb per month, respectively.  Thus, when all the groups are
operating at full capacity, the average monthly rate for the entire
AGI collaboration is expected to exceed 1.2 Mb per month.  The
philosophy of the AGI collaboration is that as the assigned regions
near completion, the coordinating committee will designate new regions
of unfinished sequence to the groups in proportion to their sequencing
capabilities.  For example, the French genome Center is tentatively
interested in sequencing BAC ends during the first year or two of
operation but after that time it is anticipated that they will engage
in sequencing a contiguous region of genomic DNA that will be decided
at a later date.
<p>
     Several of the participants had differing views about the
relative merits of sequencing unique sequences versus regions of
repetitive sequence such as centromeres and telomeres.  On the one
hand, it may be expected that the maximum number of coding sequences
will be found by sequencing the regions of low copy number.  On the
other hand, it will be interesting to know the structure of the
centromeric and telomeric regions.  The majority view appeared to be
that it was not necessary at this time to resolve this issue.
However, the majority view was that renewals of existing grants should
take into account the fact that some regions of sequence will be more
difficult to complete than others and large stretches of contiguous
sequence are more difficult to achieve than small scattered regions.
<p>
     Sequencing efficiency should be the sole criterion for choosing
which clone to sequence.  It was agreed by all parties that none of
the groups should perform service sequencing for outside groups
interested in particular clones.  The reason for this is that the
sequencing groups should not be seen to be favoring certain
colleagues.
<p>
4.  The most efficient strategy for sequencing the Arabidopsis genome
is to shotgun sequence large clones such as BACS, YACS or inserts from
P1 clones.  Most of the groups have had preliminary experience with
BACS and YACS and preferred BACS.  The fact that most of the groups
are currently satisfied with the available public BAC libraries will
facilitate coordination and exchange of information.  In particular,
in order to minimize the requirement for additional physical mapping,
it is desirable to obtain several hundred base pairs from the ends of
a large number of BAC clones so that the minimum tiling path from a
region of sequence to an overlapping clone can be determined by
database analysis.  The groups led by Craig Venter (TIGR) and Francis
Quertier (French Genome Center) agreed to sequence the ends of
approximately 14,000 BACS from public BAC libraries during the next
two years and to make the information freely available to the
community.
<p>
     All of the groups will use public BAC, YAC or P1 libraries
constructed from the Columbia ecotype that will be freely available to
the world community.  A suitable BAC library to begin with is the TAMU
BAC library constructed by Choi et al
(<a href="http://probe.nalusda.gov:8000/otherdocs/ww/Vol2/choi.html">http://probe.nalusda.gov:8000/otherdocs/ww/vol2/choi.html</a>) that is
currently available at the Ohio Stock Center.  The other BAC library
was constructed by Thomas Altmann and collaborators
(altmann@mpimp-golm.mpg.de) and is also publicly available
(<a href=http://www.rzpd.de>http://www.rzpd.de</a>).  A P1 library (the 'M library')
developed by Bob Whittier and colleagues at Mitsui is also available
at the Ohio Stock Center and a second library (the 'K library') is
being tested at the Kazusa Institute.
<p>
5. The objective of the AGI is to obtain high accuracy sequence of the
entire genome.  There was general agreement that it was not possible
to set a standard for exactly what high accuracy means or for
mechanisms to enforce high accuracy.  However, it was generally agreed
that a minimal standard would be that >97% of all sequence would be
obtained on both strands or by two chemistries.  It was the opinion of
the group that these criteria were of similar importance and that with
most clones, about seven-fold redundancy of sequencing would be
required for shotgun sequencing.
<p>
     An unknown factor affecting the accuracy of the sequence concerns
the fidelity of the BAC clones.  Preliminary experience suggests that
the BACS are generally faithful clones of the genome.  However, it
will be essential to verify the integrity of each BAC.  A minimum
criterion is that both ends of the BAC should map to the same region
of the genome, typically to the same YAC.  When 14,000 BAC ends are
sequenced, it is expected that, on average, we will have 500 bp of
sequence every 5 kb on average throughout the genome.  The resulting
library of end- sequenced BACS will represent a check on BAC integrity
that will assist in revealing any major rearrangements, deletions or
additions.  No standard was agreed upon for BAC (or P1) integrity
checking.  However, most groups indicated that comparing fingerprints
of tiled BACS would be the most appropriate criterion for integrity.
<p>
     After some discussion, it was agreed that a single-pass shotgun
sequence of the entire genome would not be worthwhile because the
combination of available ESTs and the high output rate of the AGI
collaboration would obviate much of the value of single-pass shotgun
sequencing for gene discovery.  However, because chromosome 3 will be
sequenced later than the other regions, the group endorsed a proposal
by the SPP consortium to do a feasibility study involving shotgun
sequencing of clones from chromosome 3.  After the meeting was
concluded, the SPP consortium decided that this was not a good idea
and reverted to their original plan in which "limited testing of some
of the new instrumentation being developed at Stanford will utilize
clones from a whole-genome shotgun library."
<p>
6. All of the participating laboratories are committed to early data
release via the internet.  One approach discussed at the meeting
involved daily release of preliminary sequence information (ie.,
sequences that have been edited to remove vector and regions of high
ambiguity and condensed into >1 kb contigs).  The C. elegans
sequencing groups follow this approach and the community has found it
very useful.  Two of the US groups, the SPP consortium and the
CSH-WU-ABI consortium intend to release data in this way.  Both groups
anticipate release of finished, annotated sequence within six months
of beginning to sequence a clone. The EU group does not consider it
feasible, at the moment, to do daily releases because the consortium
is composed of seventeen relatively small sequencing groups with
varying levels of technical capabilities.  The EU anticipates release
of finished annotated sequence within one month of completion. The
TIGR and Kazusa groups do not wish to release unfinished sequence
because they believe that carefully edited sequence will be most
useful to the community.  Both groups promised release of information
on a given clone to public databases within three to six months after
sequencing began.  The TIGR group will release finished, annotated
sequence within three months of beginning to sequence a BAC.  The
Kazusa group estimates that they will release finished, annotated
sequence within four to six months of beginning to sequence a clone.
In all cases, the start date for sequencing a specific clone will be
announced on linked WWW sites so that members of the community will
know when to expect the finished sequence.  In summary, all of the
groups agreed to establish linked WWW pages for posting complete lists
of all clones that have been sequenced to date, along with the start
dates of those clones that are still in progress, and the anticipated
start dates for the next set of clones to be sequenced in the future.
Each clone will therefore have a start date that will be widely
advertised to the community.  All of the groups anticipate that it
will take less than six months to completely sequence and annotate a
BAC, YAC or P1 clone and that they will deposit the complete annotated
sequences in a public database (eg.,GenBank, EMBL, JDB).  No sequence
information will be withheld from the community for the sole purpose
of benefitting selected individuals, groups, or private companies.
<p>     
7. There was consensus that the value of the sequence obtained is
proportional to the quality of annotation.  Thus, each group will
attempt to achieve a common standard of annotation.  Each group will
perform BLAST (or FASTA) searches to align ESTs and known genes and
gene products to the genomic sequence.  In addition, each group will
use programs such as GRAIL and GeneFinder to identify ORFs.
Annotation should be presented to the community in a format that can
be readily accessed and understood by plant biologists worldwide.
<p>
     It was agreed that all unassigned ORFs would be named according
to the <i>C. elegans</i> system.  A provisional agreement was reached that
the following rules of nomenclature will apply: The first letter is
the library name. T=TAMU BAC, F=IGF BAC, M=Mitsui P1 clone, K=Kazusa
P1 clone, C=cosmid clone from Goodman library.  The first letter is
followed by the microtiter plate number, then the row and column
numbers followed by a dot and the number of the ORF (numbered
sequentially from one side of the clone to the other).  Thus, a
typical ORF might be called t23a11.12 (i.e., a TAMU BAC from plate 23,
well a11, the 12th ORF from one end).  It was agreed that zeros will
not be included (ie., t23a11.12 but not t23a11.012).  It was also
suggested that the names be all lowercase for consistency.  Sometimes
it will happen that after all the ORFs have been named, a new one will
be found by some functional test or other criteria.  In this case the
two ORFs will be named with an extension to the name (eg., t23a11.12.1
and t23a11.12.2).  When two ORFs are found to belong to the same gene
or an ORF is found not to be expressed, the name will be deleted.
When one ORF spans two or more clones, the entire ORF will be given
the name of the 5' region of the ORF.
<p>
     It was recognized that annotation of a clone at the time of
deposit in public databases will rapidly be rendered obsolete because
of information about genes being discovered by the community at large.
Thus, there will be an ongoing need for annotation of previously
sequenced clones.  Because most of the groups are funded to produce
new sequence, it will be difficult for the groups producing sequence
to also take responsibility for revising the annotation of previously
completed sequence.  There was broad agreement that the task of
annotation revision should be institutionalized by assigning
responsibility for revision to the curators of the Arabidopsis
database (TAIR).  The group expressed its strong enthusiasm and
support for the continued funding of TAIR to make certain that
essential informatics components of the Arabidopsis genome project are
not overlooked.  Mike Cherry agreed that it was a suitable
responsibility for TAIR and agreed to accept the task to the extent
that resources permit.
<p>
8.  Because the US groups associated with the Arabidopsis Genome
Initiative will need to reapply for funding within 2.5 years, there
was concern about the criteria that will be used to evaluate success.
It was agreed that each of the groups will be evaluated based on their
overall contribution to the AGI collaboration and that the criteria
will not simply be dollars per kb.
<p>
9. It is considered essential to keep the entire community well
informed of technical advances and practical applications of the
genome project.  Each group will mount a WWW page that will report the
contribution of the group to the multinational sequencing effort.
Each group will also work through Mike Cherry (TAIR) and the
coordinating committee to make certain that community members receive
the training required to make efficient use of the extensive sequence
data that will be generated over the next several years.  In addition,
the coordinating committee will evaluate the feasibility of appointing
a part-time public relations specialist to produce user-friendly
documentation about the progress of the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative.
These efforts should help to advertise the dramatic impact that
sequencing the Arabidopsis genome will have on basic and applied
research in plant biology.
