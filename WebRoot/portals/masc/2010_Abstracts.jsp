        <blockquote>Long-Term Goal and Background: The long-term goal of this research project
     is to facilitate the assignment of function to every gene in Arabidopsis
     thaliana. To date, the function of the proteins encoded by more than 20% of
     plant genes is completely unknown, with the function of up to 43% of these
     proteins poorly characterized. The specific focus of this research is genes of
     unknown function and the networks that respond to environmental stress, such as
     chilling, drought, salt, flooding, high light, and oxidative environments.
     Environmental stress is the primary cause of crop loss world-wide. A plant's
     survival and growth is dependent on its ability to cope with environmental
     stresses. It is clear that a plant's stress response results from a complex set
     of changes in gene networks and metabolism. While 1000s of genes have been
     linked to stress networks, in only a few cases have their biochemical and
     genetic functions been elucidated. In fact, most of the stress-regulated genes
     identified to date have completely unknown function(s). Specific Aims and
     Expected Outcome: 1. Determine the change in stress tolerance for &gt; 1,600 plant
     lines with a disrupted expression of genes of unknown function. The approach is
     to test plant lines for resistance or susceptibility to stresses including
     water deficit, salt, high light, heat, chilling, freezing, anaerobiosis, heavy
     metal and oxidative stress. The primary goal is to begin a systematic approach
     to evaluate the contribution of all Arabidopsis genes to stress tolerance.
     Expected outcome: Assigning a putative function to &gt; 1,600 genes with an
     unknown function. 2. Determine the relationship of genes of unknown function
     within a global protein-protein interaction network. The approach is to
     determine &gt; 20,000 examples of protein-protein interactions using a random
     yeast two-hybrid screening strategy. The primary goal is to uncover links
     between genes of known and unknown function. Expected outcome: A
     protein-protein map for Arabidopsis. 3. Over-express &gt; 150 selected genes of
     unknown function in plants, test transgenic plants for changes in stress
     tolerance, and search for interacting protein partners. The hypothesis to be
     tested for each gene is that its over-expression can alter a particular stress
     response. Expected outcome: Identifying proteins of unknown function with a
     central importance in stress response and their protein partners. 4. Profile
     changes in gene expression in &gt; 20 stress-response mutants grown under at least
     two different stress conditions. The primary goal is to begin creating a
     network of gene expression changes that can help better focus in-depth
     experiments on enzymes and regulators of potential importance to environmental
     stress. Expected outcome: Identifying gene networks involved in environmental
     stress. 5. Coordinate a centralized website for information on genes of unknown
     function ("unknowns") from Arabidopsis and provide outreach and training
     activities for those under privileged and underrepresented in science, on the
     role of science in agriculture, the environment, and human health. Web-based
     resources will be established to disseminate unpublished information and link
     annotation and data to all Arabidopsis "unknowns". All plant lines and results
     of the project will be released to the academic community on a biannual basis.
     Expected outcome: A centralized website to enhance research on genes with
     unknown function. Broader Impacts: The two key "Broader Impacts" of the
     proposed research are: 1) development and maintenance of a centralized website
     for information on Arabidopsis genes of unknown function. This site will track
     and disseminate information on homozygous T-DNA insertion lines for "unknown"
     genes and their phenotypes, and provide gene structure, gene annotation,
     protein interaction and mRNA profiling data. 2) Educational outreach for K-12
     and interdisciplinary training to postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduates
     trainees. A summer outreach workshop will teach high school students about
     Mendelian inheritance in Arabidopsis, the role of science in agriculture, the
     environment, and human health. This laboratory-based internship program will
     provide self-confidence building experiences and expose the students to
     laboratories and scientists. Both undergraduate and K-12 outreach and training
     activities will target the under privileged and underrepresented in science<p></p></blockquote>

NSF Award Abstract 
<a href="https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/servlet/showaward?award=0420199">0420199</a></p>
        <blockquote> This 2010 project will determine specific functions for 59 genes of CoA
     metabolism.  The genes include 44 encoding carboxy-CoA ligases and 15 encoding
     carboxy-CoA thioesterases.  Currently, only 11 of these 59 genes have known
     functions.  CoA-linked substrates are central to intermediary metabolism and to
     pathways that produce structural building blocks of the cell and its
     organelles, many chemicals that protect plants against biotic and abiotic
     stresses, and several hormones.  Catabolic pathways that recycle carbon also
     depend upon CoA.  Many CoA pathways have been resistant to biochemical and
     genetic investigation.  This project is important because it will provide
     biochemical and genetic access points in many pathways to which the genes
     collectively contribute.  Assigning definitive functions for the genes will
     require parallel/integrated deployment of four strategies:  1) Bioinformatics
     approaches including transcript profiling, promoter motif analysis, and
     modeling of protein structures.  2) Biochemical assays of recombinant proteins
     will identify substrates and define enzyme kinetics.  3) Tissue-specific
     expression and subcellular-targeting information will distinguish pathways
     utilizing different isozymes.  4) Reverse genetics (knockout/RNAi/TILLING as
     appropriate) and overexpression will define the broader biological context.
     These results will provide critical first openings into a number of biochemical
     pathways in Arabidopsis and new information about others. Broader
     Impacts: Because many CoA-linked pathways are poorly understood currently, the
     results from this project will facilitate investigations in diverse areas of
     plant biology.  Information developed under this project will be available
     directly (http://www.ibc.wsu.edu/research/browse/NSF2010) and incorporated into
     AraCyc and other TAIR databases.  Biological resources will be available
     through the Stock Centers.  Eventually, better understanding of the 59 genes
     that are the focus of this research will contribute to improved capabilities in
     many areas of agriculture, forestry and environmental management.  These
     broader impacts will be assisted by close contacts with industry.  Washington
     State University has a strong commitment to diversity in student training, and
     has several active programs for recruitment of minority and underrepresented
     groups.  Both graduate and undergraduate students will receive training in
     research techniques and scientific logic through their involvement in this
     research project.<p></p></blockquote>

NSF Award Abstract

</a>
</p>
        <blockquote>The Arabidopsis genome encodes more than 200 Leucine-Rich Repeat
     Receptor-like kinases (LRR RLKs) with an organization of functional domains
     similar to that of animal receptor kinases. Several LRR RLKs are known to be
     critical elements in signaling pathways regulating plant development and
     response to the environment, but the biological functions of most members of
     this large family of putative receptors remain unknown. This project will
     acquire fundamental biochemical knowledge of the kinase domains of all
     Arabidopsis LRR RLKs by using Gateway cloning and high-throughput liquid
     robotics for in vitro analysis of autophosphorylation activity, substrate
     preference and pair-wise interactions. A proteomic analysis of membrane
     proteins isolated from Arabidopsis plants grown under a variety of
     physiological conditions will be used to identify a subset of 30 LRR RLKs for
     detailed analysis of in vivo autophosphorylation sites by mass spectrometry.
     The functional significance of selected phosphorylation sites will be examined
     using genetic and biochemical approaches, and interaction between selected LRR
     RLKs in planta will also be examined.  Information about the project, including
     a list of genes studied can be obtained at
     http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/hort_sci/faculty/clouse.html.
     Significance to
     2010 Project Objectives-- Identification of specific phosphorylation sites and
     their functional significance will advance our understanding of RLK signaling
     mechanisms and provide a comparative database of phosphorylation sites for
     membrane localized kinases. The family-wide analysis of LRR RLK kinase domains
     may reveal new aspects of the evolution of function in multigene families and
     studies of in vivo interactions may uncover novel heterodimers, suggesting
     possible cross-talk between signaling pathways.
     Broader Impact of the
     Proposed Activity--Phosphorylation sites determined in this study will be
     posted regularly on the PlantsP database (http://plantsp.sdsc.edu), creating a
     unique community resource for comparative study. A variety of tagged constructs
     in Gateway vectors for in vitro and in vivo studies of Arabidopsis LRR RLKs
     will be deposited in the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center, along with
     numerous lines of transgenic plants. Given the known importance of several LRR
     RLKs to plant development, it is likely that increased knowledge of this gene
     family could have practical agricultural impact. The project will provide
     excellent training in protein biochemistry, mass spectrometry, and Arabidopsis
     molecular genetics at all levels from high school student interns through
     postdoctoral scientists in an environment that encourages the participation of
     underrepresented minorities.<p></p></blockquote>

</a>
</p>
        <blockquote>This project will provide research tools and resources for the plant
     science community to determine the in planta interactions of proteins. The
     research will develop Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BMFC)
     methodology to investigate protein-protein interactions in planta. BMFC
     involves tagging proteins with complementary half-YFP molecules, neither of
     which fluoresces on its own. When half-YFP molecules are brought together as
     fusions with interacting proteins, fluorescence is restored. The BMFC design is
     a novel in planta "two hybrid" system. BMFC can also be utilized to identify
     the subcellular location of interacting proteins. The project will develop BMFC
     vectors to express half-YFP-tagged proteins for use both in transient
     transformation experiments, and for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The
     vectors will incorporate Gateway technology for high-throughput mobilization of
     amplified genes and cDNA libraries among the various vectors. Several
     Arabidopsis cDNA-coding regions will be cloned into the BMFC vectors; these
     genes are representative of large families of cytoskeleton, importin,
     chromatin, and F-box proteins. The project will also provide several
     Arabidopsis cDNA expression libraries in these vectors, which will be useful
     for comprehensive screens for protein interactions. As proof of concept, the
     project will test these tagged plant proteins for interaction with tagged
     Agrobacterium Virulence proteins in both transient and stable transformation
     assays. The tagged Virulence proteins include VirE2, VirD2, and VirF, as well
     as the Arabidopsis protein VIP1. The test Arabidopsis proteins will be selected
     based upon prior genetic and biochemical information. The limits of sensitivity
     of expression of the tagged proteins will be determined using both high-level
     constitutive as well as native promoters. All data derived from this project
     will be posted on the project web site:
     http://www.bio.purdue.edu/about/faculty/gelvin/gelvinweb/gelvin.html
     Broader Impacts: This project will develop the first broad-based technology to
     investigate protein-protein interactions in planta, and will additionally
     identify plant proteins whose expression may be manipulated to increase the
     frequency of Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of recalcitrant plant
     species. This project also contains a substantial training component. In
     addition to training postdoctoral research scientists and technicians, the
     project will include a vigorous outreach program with local colleges to
     identify undergraduate students from under-represented minority groups and
     introduce them, through summer and academic year collaborations with our
     research groups, to the conduct of scientific research. Multi-year training of
     these students to solidify their interest in pursuing a career in science will
     be encouraged. When they return to their home institutions, the students will
     expose additional students to the techniques learned in our laboratories. The
     under-represented minority students trained in the project during the summer
     will continue their research at their home institutions, thus broadening the
     number of their peers who will come into contact with scientific research. We
     expect that these efforts will encourage undergraduate students to select a
     career in science.<p></p></blockquote>

</p>
        <blockquote> This project
     will determine the function of a network of genes involved in disease
     resistance. The genes studied will be chosen from among those found to be
     expressed at increased levels after pathogen infection.  As several thousand
     genes satisfy this condition, genes will be prioritized based on other
     characteristics, such as rapid expression changes or annotation suggesting
     functions in signaling, secondary metabolism, or unknown function.  There are
     four Specific Aims: 1. Obtain global expression profiles for Arabidopsis
     responses to P. syringae infection. 2.  Identify genes that contribute to
     resistance to P. syringae. 3.  Identify genes comprising the defense signaling
     circuitry controlling activation of defense responses. 4.  Model the defense
     signaling circuitry using gene expression profiles of regulatory mutants. A
     description of the project, including a list of genes under study named by
     Arabidopsis Gene Index numbers, allele numbers of mutants under study, project
     status and preliminary results, will be available to the public at:
     http://www.cbs.umn.edu/labs/glazebrook/NSF2010/. The function of selected genes
     in disease resistance will be determined using mutants with defects in the
     selected genes.  These mutants will be tested for enhanced susceptibility to
     pathogen attack and altered expression profiles following infection.  Based on
     the expression profile data, a model of the topology of the signal transduction
     network controlling activation of defense responses will be constructed.
     Results will be shared at http://www.cbs.umn.edu/labs/glazebrook/NSF2010/ as
     soon as they are judged to be reliable.  Such results will include data from
     global expression profiling experiments (expected within 18 months from project
     start, and also posted at TAIR),  pathogen susceptibility data from mutant
     lines (beginning 18 months from project start), expression profiles from mutant
     lines (beginning 24 months from project start), and network topology models
     (prior to the end of the project).  In addition, project results will be shared
     at conferences and in publications in the scientific literature. The project
     addresses the 2010 program objective of determining functions for networks of
     genes involved in a particular biological process.  In this case, the
     biological process is activation of a defense response to pathogen attack. The
     project will have broader impacts in the area of integration of research and
     education.  These include participation of undergraduates, including those from
     under-represented groups, involvement of graduate students and post-doctoral
     fellows in laboratory teaching of undergraduates, development of a mentoring
     program for undergraduates involved in laboratory research, and integration of
     research results into a bioinformatics course.  Improved understanding of plant
     disease resistance mechanisms has potential applications in crop improvement.<p>

</a>
</p>
        <blockquote> Hierarchical arrangements (networks) of transcription factors (TFs)
     provide the information necessary to deploy genes with particular spatial and
     temporal patterns. The information for this is hardwired in the promoter
     regions formed by cis-regulatory elements that bind specific TFs. Direct target
     genes for a group of 31 selected TFs involved in regulatory networks associated
     with flower development and epidermal functions will be identified using
     chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by analysis of microarrays of promoter
     sequences (ChIP-CHIP).  Identified direct target genes will be validated by in
     vitro DNA-binding experiments, and the TF binding sites will be determined
     using in vitro footprinting.  The information obtained will be integrated into
     the established AGRIS databases, resulting in public resources that integrate
     TFs, their binding sites and the corresponding regulatory motifs. Results
     derived from this project will be made available at
     http://arabidopsis.med.ohio-state.edu/NSF2010Project. Materials developed in
     this research will be made readily available through the ABRC. The combination
     of experimental data and powerful computational tools will provide the first
     steps towards establishing the regulatory networks responsible for the
     expression of all Arabidopsis genes, one of the central objectives of the 2010
     project.
     Broader Impact - Establishing the regulatory networks that
     control the expression of all plant genes provides a natural follow-up to the
     elucidation of the Arabidopsis genome and will significantly impact the
     research in Arabidopsis and other plants.  This project integrates experimental
     biology, bioinformatics, statistics and mathematics, offering unique
     opportunities for interdisciplinary research training.  The development of
     several databases available through the Web will continue to ensure that
     findings derived from this work will have the broadest possible dissemination.
     Tools and resources obtained from these studies will be applied for educational
     purposes in courses at California State University, San Marcos and Ohio State
     University.<p></p></blockquote>

        <blockquote> The objective of the project is to use high throughput ICP-MS
     technology to identify gene networks that control uptake and accumulation of a
     wide array of minerals, the "ionome".  The prioritized list of target genes is
     based on four criteria.  First, all genes have unknown functions.  Second,
     priority has been given to genes expressed primarily in roots, as uptake and
     translocation functions in the root have a significant influence on leaf and
     seed ion profiles.  Third, priority is given to those genes that show
     expression profile changes in response to nutrients.  A critical hypothesis to
     be tested is whether expression profiling changes can be used to identify
     functionally important genes.  Fourth, priority will be given to unique genes
     to test the hypothesis that defects in unique genes are more likely to generate
     a phenotype than mutations in genes with close homologs in the genome.  A
     complete gene list is available at http://www.cbs.umn.edu/arabidopsis/ionome/. 
     All the ion profiling data will be available and searchable online, with seeds
     for various lines available through the ABRC.  Analysis of the ionome and its
     interactions with other cellular processes is essential to understand how
     plants respond to nutrient availability and toxic metals.  The collaborative
     group will serve as a "Center of Expertise" to test the hypothesis that &gt; 5% of
     the genome functions in plant mineral nutrition. The long-term goal is to
     quantify the functional contribution to mineral nutrition and ion homeostasis
     of every gene in Arabidopsis.  The main objectives are to: o  Conduct ion
     profiling (quantitation of Fe, Zn, Ca, K, Mn, P, S, Se, Na, Pb, As, etc.) in
     leaves and seeds of 1600 homozygous disruption lines isolated in genes of
     unknown function, and thousands of additional lines made available by the
     Arabidopsis community. o  Conduct saturation mutagenesis, using &gt;100,000 fast
     neutron (FN) mutagenized lines to identify genes that regulate mineral nutrient
     accumulation. o  Identify the mutant genes in more than 50 ion profile mutants
     obtained from FN mutagenesis. o  Conduct expression profiling experiments on 10
     lines with altered ion profiles.  The goal is to correlate ionome and
     transcriptome profiling results to understand the networks controlling ion
     homeostasis. Broader Impacts: There are four key contributions to the
     Broader Impacts of the proposed research. 1) Educational outreach will include
     training of undergraduate and graduate students.  2) Information on the
     contribution of science to human health, agriculture, and bioremediation will
     be disseminated through museum exhibits and interactions with the PIs' local
     communities. 3) Research tools will be provided to the public through web sites
     and seed line deposits at stock centers.  4) Fundamental knowledge will be
     provided to facilitate future engineering of increased yields and of more
     nutritious agricultural crops.  For most of the world, plants are the major
     source of essential minerals.  Food-based solutions to "hidden hunger" offer
     sustainable solutions to problems of malnutrition. Therefore, this project will
     contribute to increasing bio-available minerals in plants and to solving
     important problems in human health.  Furthermore, understanding the pathways by
     which toxic metals accumulate in plants will enable the engineering of crops to
     exclude toxic metals and create healthier food sources, or to extract toxic
     metals from the soil as a strategy to clean up polluted lands and water.<p></p></blockquote>

</a>
</p>
        <blockquote> This research will determine the function of subtilase
     genes in Arabidopsis.  Subtilase genes encode subtilisin-like serine proteases,
     proteins that play important roles in plant growth and development.   In
     mammalian systems, some subtilases are called "hormone convertases" because
     they cut other proteins releasing bioactive peptides that serve as hormones
     and/or function in cell-to-cell signaling.  The properties of some plant
     subtilases suggest they may play similar roles in plant development and
     physiology. The function of nearly 60 subtilase genes in Arabidopsis
     will be investigated through collaboration with European partners in The
     Arabidopsis Subtilase Consortium (TASC).  A listing of all the genes in the
     subtilase gene family (and their subfamily identification) is found at
     http://csbdb.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/csbdb/dbcawp/psdb/main/mgenes.html.  This
     research will focus on the role of ten subtilase genes that are highly
     regulated during shoot regeneration in tissue culture.  Three of these
     subtilase genes appear to influence shoot development in that the expression of
     these genes is controlled by a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) that
     determines shoot regeneration efficiency.  Shoot regeneration efficiency varies
     in Arabidopsis and in some important economic crops where it can impede the
     successful application of genetic engineering technologies.  Another seven
     subtilase genes are differentially regulated during shoot or root
     regeneration. A proteomics approach (the study of a large number of
     proteins using protein expression profiling) will be used to understand the
     function of the subtilases. The function of these genes in vivo will be
     examined by quantitatively analyzing 2D difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE)
     profiles of T-DNA insertion mutants and transgenics with induced expression of
     subtilase genes.  Subtilase target sites will be determined by analyzing the
     products from the limited digestion of common substrate proteins by the
     recombinant enzyme.  Optimal subtilase target sites will be determined by
     designing and testing the hydrolysis of synthetic peptides related to the
     cleavage sites for common substrates.Research results will shared with
     the public and other members of the scientific community through
     http://csbdb.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/csbdb/dbcawp/psdb.html.  Information at this
     site is edited by the Altmann lab and will be updated on a monthly basis.  This
     research is significant to the goals of the 2010 project in that it contributes
     to our understanding of a group of important genes that influence plant growth
     and development.  This research makes a unique contribution in that it uses new
     tools in proteomics to address gene function. Broader impact. This
     project has broader impact because it contributes knowledge to the role of
     proteolysis and peptide signaling in plant development.   Little is known about
     bioactive plant peptides from genomics because peptides are often embedded in
     other proteins and are not released until cleaved by proteases, such as
     subtilases.The project also has broader impact because it provides lab
     research training for Iowa State University and Des Moines Area Community
     College undergraduates.  Some of the undergraduate trainees will also have the
     opportunity to conduct research during the summer in international labs of
     partners associated with TASC. To encourage ISU minority undergrads to
     participate in this project, we will host a meeting each fall in the Roy J.
     Carver Co-Laboratory for the local chapter of Minorities in Agriculture,
     Natural Resources and Related Sciences (MANRRS).<p></p></blockquote>

        <blockquote> Drought stress is ubiquitous and has played an important selective role in
     the evolution of plant growth, development, and physiology.  It is also a major
     limiting factor to crop productivity worldwide. This 2010 project will use
     genome-wide molecular techniques to study the quantitative genetics of
     adaptation to differences in water availability in the model plant, Arabidopsis
     thaliana.  A major goal of the project is to map and identify genomic regions
     and characterize genes and gene networks that function in escape, avoidance,
     and tolerance of drought among plants adapted to habitats spanning extremes of
     water availability.  In addition, new resources will be developed for the study
     of quantitative genetics in Arabidopsis, including a mapping population and a
     series of genetic lines capturing genes controlling key components of plant
     physiology related to drought adaptation. This project builds on the
     infrastructure of genomic data and tools developed by the Arabidopsis research
     community, and will link molecular variation of functional genes to
     evolutionary processes.  The ultimate goal of this research is to determine
     why, as well as how, the Arabidopsis thaliana genome has evolved functional
     variation in traits important for adaptation to habitats differing in water
     availability. The significance of the proposed work in relation to the
     overall 2010 project objectives is twofold.  First, most traits of ecological
     and agricultural significance are quantitative and influenced by many genes as
     well as by the environment.  Unfortunately, little is known about the molecular
     genetic details underlying quantitative genetic variation.  Understanding the
     genetics of quantitative variation will be necessary for a complete elucidation
     of the function of all Arabidopsis thaliana genes.  In addition, results of
     this project will complement ongoing efforts to characterize the genetics of
     constitutive and inducible traits that enhance stress tolerance in plants.  The
     study of naturally evolved variation is a largely unexplored avenue for
     understanding the molecular genetic basis of plant stress responses.  Secondly,
     genetic mapping resources, genetic lines, and improved analytical methods
     developed through the project will facilitate future quantitative genetic
     studies of Arabidopsis thaliana.  The broader impact of the proposed research
     includes integrated training for students and postdoctoral scholars in
     molecular genetics, evolutionary biology, physiology, and bioinformatics -
     skills necessary for the next generation of successful genomic scientists.
     All plant materials and associated genotypic data will be made available
     using The Arabidopsis Information Resource infrastructure
     (http://www.arabidopsis.org .  Progress and details of particular aspects of
     the project will be available at the project website
     (http://orthos.bio.umassd.edu:8080/Arabidopsis/drought), available in October
     2004.<p></p></blockquote>

        <blockquote> Wild Arabidopsis strains are a rich source of natural genetic variation
     not present in common laboratory strains.  One way to exploit this variation is
     to incorporate wild stocks into genetic mapping populations called Recombinant
     Inbred Lines (RIL).  These lines allow researchers to finely map all the plant
     genes affecting any quantifiable trait.  Mapping these Quantitative Trait Loci
     (QTL) indicates how many genes affect a trait and how strongly each gene acts,
     and places them on a genetic map.  Mapping must precede the molecular
     identification of the genes, a main goal of the Arabidopsis 2010 initiative.
     Alan Lloyd's project will construct five new RIL populations (300 lines per
     population, 200 markers per line).  All will be publicly available from the
     Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center at Ohio State University.  Mapping data
     will be on-line through The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR).  The first
     two sets of medium-density maps will be available in 2004, the last three in
     2005.  High density maps will be released in 2005 and 2006. QTL analysis
     in Arabidopsis thaliana will contribute to understanding the genetics of such
     crop traits as yield, disease resistance, and drought tolerance.  This research
     provides opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to learn modern
     biotechnology and creative thinking, and undergraduate students are strongly
     encouraged to get first-hand lab experience.<p></p></blockquote>

        <blockquote>Long-Term Goal and Background: The long-term goal of this research project
     is to facilitate the assignment of function to every gene in Arabidopsis
     thaliana. To date, the function of the proteins encoded by more than 20% of
     plant genes is completely unknown, with the function of up to 43% of these
     proteins poorly characterized. The specific focus of this research is genes of
     unknown function and the networks that respond to environmental stress, such as
     chilling, drought, salt, flooding, high light, and oxidative environments.
     Environmental stress is the primary cause of crop loss world-wide. A plant's
     survival and growth is dependent on its ability to cope with environmental
     stresses. It is clear that a plant's stress response results from a complex set
     of changes in gene networks and metabolism. While 1000s of genes have been
     linked to stress networks, in only a few cases have their biochemical and
     genetic functions been elucidated. In fact, most of the stress-regulated genes
     identified to date have completely unknown function(s). Specific Aims and
     Expected Outcome: 1. Determine the change in stress tolerance for &gt; 1,600 plant
     lines with a disrupted expression of genes of unknown function. The approach is
     to test plant lines for resistance or susceptibility to stresses including
     water deficit, salt, high light, heat, chilling, freezing, anaerobiosis, heavy
     metal and oxidative stress. The primary goal is to begin a systematic approach
     to evaluate the contribution of all Arabidopsis genes to stress tolerance.
     Expected outcome: Assigning a putative function to &gt; 1,600 genes with an
     unknown function. 2. Determine the relationship of genes of unknown function
     within a global protein-protein interaction network. The approach is to
     determine &gt; 20,000 examples of protein-protein interactions using a random
     yeast two-hybrid screening strategy. The primary goal is to uncover links
     between genes of known and unknown function. Expected outcome: A
     protein-protein map for Arabidopsis. 3. Over-express &gt; 150 selected genes of
     unknown function in plants, test transgenic plants for changes in stress
     tolerance, and search for interacting protein partners. The hypothesis to be
     tested for each gene is that its over-expression can alter a particular stress
     response. Expected outcome: Identifying proteins of unknown function with a
     central importance in stress response and their protein partners. 4. Profile
     changes in gene expression in &gt; 20 stress-response mutants grown under at least
     two different stress conditions. The primary goal is to begin creating a
     network of gene expression changes that can help better focus in-depth
     experiments on enzymes and regulators of potential importance to environmental
     stress. Expected outcome: Identifying gene networks involved in environmental
     stress. 5. Coordinate a centralized website for information on genes of unknown
     function ("unknowns") from Arabidopsis and provide outreach and training
     activities for those under privileged and underrepresented in science, on the
     role of science in agriculture, the environment, and human health. Web-based
     resources will be established to disseminate unpublished information and link
     annotation and data to all Arabidopsis "unknowns". All plant lines and results
     of the project will be released to the academic community on a biannual basis.
     Expected outcome: A centralized website to enhance research on genes with
     unknown function. Broader Impacts: The two key "Broader Impacts" of the
     proposed research are: 1) development and maintenance of a centralized website
     for information on Arabidopsis genes of unknown function. This site will track
     and disseminate information on homozygous T-DNA insertion lines for "unknown"
     genes and their phenotypes, and provide gene structure, gene annotation,
     protein interaction and mRNA profiling data. 2) Educational outreach for K-12
     and interdisciplinary training to postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduates
     trainees. A summer outreach workshop will teach high school students about
     Mendelian inheritance in Arabidopsis, the role of science in agriculture, the
     environment, and human health. This laboratory-based internship program will
     provide self-confidence building experiences and expose the students to
     laboratories and scientists. Both undergraduate and K-12 outreach and training
     activities will target the under privileged and underrepresented in science.<p></p></blockquote>

</a>
</p>
        <blockquote> This NSF 2010 project will examine the function of
     a family of genes that encodes a novel, plant-specific protein domain, the LOB
     domain. In Arabidopsis, 43 LBD genes encode proteins that contain a LOB domain,
     a conserved domain of approximately 100 amino acids that does not contain any
     recognizable sequence motifs.  Proteins containing LOB-domains are not found
     outside of plants, making this gene family one of about 150 plant-specific gene
     families in Arabidopsis.  The only LBD gene with a defined genetic function,
     ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2 (AS2), regulates adaxial-abaxial polarity in lateral organs
     and is required for repression of the KNOX class of transcription factors.  The
     functions of other LBD genes are not known.  Information on the status of the
     project will be maintained at a public database
     (http://faculty.ucr.edu/~pspringe). Functional characterization of LBD genes
     will be accomplished by determining the mRNA expression patterns of each gene,
     and by generating transgenic plants that have increased or decreased activity
     of select family members.  Clones and transgenic plants that are generated as a
     result of this research will be freely distributed through the Arabidopsis
     Biological Resource Center (ABRC).  Research results will be presented at
     scientific meetings and published in scientific journals in a timely fashion.
     Functional characterization of LBD genes, which encode proteins of unknown
     function, fits the goal of the 2010 program to determine the function of all
     Arabidopsis genes, especially those genes whose function can't be predicted by
     homology.  In addition, understanding the function of plant-specific genes like
     the LBD genes will likely yield important information about processes that are
     unique to plants. This project also establishes an international collaboration
     with the University of Duesseldorf. Broader Impacts:  An important
     component of the project is the development of teaching resources utilizing the
     LBD genes.  Undergraduate students in courses at UMass Boston and UC Riverside
     will undertake hypothesis-driven research on the LBD genes, and will have
     access to project data and mutant and transgenic plants for their research.  In
     addition, a workshop focused on incorporation of plant molecular genetics into
     the high school curriculum will be developed for high school teachers in the
     Boston public school district and in the Riverside and San Bernardino public
     school districts.  Modules for teaching at the high school, community college,
     and four-year college will be developed using the LBD genes as illustrative
     models.<p></p></blockquote>

        <blockquote> Drought stress is ubiquitous and has played an important selective role in
     the evolution of plant growth, development, and physiology.  It is also a major
     limiting factor to crop productivity worldwide. This 2010 project will use
     genome-wide molecular techniques to study the quantitative genetics of
     adaptation to differences in water availability in the model plant, Arabidopsis
     thaliana.  A major goal of the project is to map and identify genomic regions
     and characterize genes and gene networks that function in escape, avoidance,
     and tolerance of drought among plants adapted to habitats spanning extremes of
     water availability.  In addition, new resources will be developed for the study
     of quantitative genetics in Arabidopsis, including a mapping population and a
     series of genetic lines capturing genes controlling key components of plant
     physiology related to drought adaptation. This project builds on the
     infrastructure of genomic data and tools developed by the Arabidopsis research
     community, and will link molecular variation of functional genes to
     evolutionary processes.  The ultimate goal of this research is to determine
     why, as well as how, the Arabidopsis thaliana genome has evolved functional
     variation in traits important for adaptation to habitats differing in water
     availability. The significance of the proposed work in relation to the
     overall 2010 project objectives is twofold.  First, most traits of ecological
     and agricultural significance are quantitative and influenced by many genes as
     well as by the environment.  Unfortunately, little is known about the molecular
     genetic details underlying quantitative genetic variation.  Understanding the
     genetics of quantitative variation will be necessary for a complete elucidation
     of the function of all Arabidopsis thaliana genes.  In addition, results of
     this project will complement ongoing efforts to characterize the genetics of
     constitutive and inducible traits that enhance stress tolerance in plants.  The
     study of naturally evolved variation is a largely unexplored avenue for
     understanding the molecular genetic basis of plant stress responses.  Secondly,
     genetic mapping resources, genetic lines, and improved analytical methods
     developed through the project will facilitate future quantitative genetic
     studies of Arabidopsis thaliana.  The broader impact of the proposed research
     includes integrated training for students and postdoctoral scholars in
     molecular genetics, evolutionary biology, physiology, and bioinformatics -
     skills necessary for the next generation of successful genomic scientists.
     All plant materials and associated genotypic data will be made available
     using The Arabidopsis Information Resource infrastructure
     (http://www.arabidopsis.org .  Progress and details of particular aspects of
     the project will be available at the project website
     (http://orthos.bio.umassd.edu:8080/Arabidopsis/drought), available in October
     2004.<p></p></blockquote>

        <blockquote>The receptor-like protein kinases (RLKs) are the largest class of
     Arabidopsis protein kinases. This class, which based on phylogenetic analysis
     contains both transmembrane and cytoplasmic protein kinases, consists of at
     least 610 members and thus represents about 2.5% of the protein encoding genes
     in Arabidopsis . 417 of the RLK genes contain a putative ligand binding domain,
     a single transmembrane domain and a predicted cytoplasmic protein kinase
     domain, and thus are predicted to function as receptors.  These 417 genes can
     be classified into 21 different types based on the sequences found in their
     extracellular domains.  However, there is currently functional information on
     fewer than a dozen of the transmembrane RLKs.  This research will focus on 61
     of the 216 RLK genes that contain extracellular leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). 
     Six well characterized RLK mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana :erecta, clavata1,
     brassinosteroid insensitive1, excess microsporocytes1, vascular highway1, and
     haesa belong to the LRR VII, X, XI and XII families.  Based on what is known
     about the functions of these six well characterized LRR RLKs it is reasonable
     to hypothesize that many of the uncharacterized LRR VII, X, XI and XIII genes
     are likely to play interesting and important roles in plant growth and
     development.  Two emerging themes are:  that receptor kinases are part of a
     cellular network of regulatory proteins that includes physical interactions
     with other RLKs, and that some receptor kinases are involved in similar or
     overlapping processes.  Using existing tools and technologies, the biological
     functions of each gene will be determined by isolation and characterization of
     both loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations and examination of
     expression of the LRR VII, X, XI and XIII genes. The regulatory networks that
     mediate signaling by these protein kinases will also be defined. Network
     of genes: The figure on the URL :http://www.mcb.arizona.edu/tax/login.cfm,
     shows a phylogenetic tree of the LRR RLKs in this project and a short
     description of the project. This will be linked to Frans Tax 's website.  There
     will be links to this from TAIR, PlantsP and the websites from the other
     participants in the project. Definition of determining the function:  The
     function of these RLKs will be determined through the analysis of the
     phenotypes of single and multiple mutants and by analysis of the networks these
     RLKs participate in through results from the yeast two-hybrid system. 
     Additional information to test for phenotypes will come from analysis of the
     expression patterns and from the analysis by others on RLK activity under
     specific environmental conditions. What,how,when and where results will
     be shared: When single or multiple insertion or TILLING mutants are verified,
     they will be added to the project website and seeds sent to the stock center.
     The results of phenotypic screens using Gantlet protocols will be displayed on
     the website,as well photographs of the promoter:GUS expression patterns. These
     results will also be linked to PlantsP. All seed, strains and molecular
     reagents generated by this project will be deposited in the ABRC with a full
     description. Results from these experiments will also be presented at meetings
     and submitted for publication in a timely manner. This 2010 project
     targets a unique set of plant genes of unknown function that are expected to
     have fundamental roles in the control of plant growth and development. Although
     a great deal is known about signaling networks in other organisms with
     completed genomes, relatively little is known about the mechanisms by which
     plant cells perceive and transduce developmental and environmental signals. The
     availability of several recently developed tools and technologies provides the
     means to rapidly advance the understanding of the biological functions of the
     LRR RLKs . Broader Impacts The broader impacts of the project include the
     partnership with high school teachers to adapt the research materials for high
     school students participating in the Partnership for Research and Education in
     Plants (PREP), as well as the development of training workshops for teachers
     and scientists to prepare them to participate in PREP.  This project also
     provides specific mentoring and training for undergraduate students that are
     members of underrepresented minority groups.<p></p></blockquote>

        <blockquote>In order to determine the gene function for a network of genes, the
     circuitry of plant defense against pathogen will be derived from temporal and
     spatial large-scale mRNA profiling of powdery mildew infection of Arabidopsis. 
     Laser capture microdissection will be utilized to isolate RNA from distinct
     populations of plant cells (including infected epidermal cells and neighboring
     epidermal and mesophyll cells) at a sampling rate and with sufficient time
     points to capture the underlying biological processes. To analyze this mRNA
     expression data, novel statistical approaches will be developed.  For example,
     time-alignment algorithms will be used to synchronize data among experiments
     and evaluate altered temporal patterns of response including time delays and
     period compression/expansion.  Modeling the circuitry of plant defense allows
     for the rigorous assessment of the regulatory factors and downstream products
     impacting the progression of infection.  Continuous representations will be
     used to derive the circuitry of response, allowing one to uncover network nodes
     and subnodes associated with distinct functional responses.  Experimental
     testing of predicted gene function will focus on genes in subnodes of salicylic
     acid (SA)-impacted networks elucidated using an SA biosynthetic mutant.  In
     addition, defining these networks and nodes allows for discovery and assessment
     of network motifs such as feed-forward loops used to solve a common biological
     "problem" in diverse circumstances and species. This spatially and temporally
     resolved expression data, the statistical and computational approaches and
     tools, and the identified defense circuitry and network motifs will all be of
     significant value to the Arabidopsis community.  Previous datasets collected
     from whole leaf samples and few time points were unable to resolve much of the
     complexity of the defense response.  Numerous predictions of gene function and
     regulation will emerge from these efforts.Model-driven experiments will focus
     on genes in SA-impacted nodes and subnodes. These genes are not known a
     priori, but will be determined from the modeling efforts.  Likely genes
     include: transcription factor(s) involved in the induction of ICS1 and PR1
     clusters, a putative SA glucosyltransferase, candidate genes for the second
     enzyme involved in the synthesis of SA from isochorismate, and a putative
     transcriptional repressor responsible for the SA-dependent repression of the
     PDF1.2 cluster.  The expression data will be deposited in public databases such
     as the Integrated Microarray Database System being developed as part of the NSF
     Arabidopsis 2010 award to X. Dong and co-PIs and will be freely available for
     use.  In addition, developed algorithms and computational tools will be
     available for download and will be included as tools in Bioconductor, a free
     microarray analysis platform.  Information about this project is available at
     http://plantbio.berkeley.edu:16080/~wildermuth/.Broader Impacts This
     research will result in a more comprehensive understanding of plant-pathogen
     interactions by providing a formal mathematical framework for molecular genetic
     and biochemical data. The strategies elucidated for this plant-pathogen
     interaction are likely applicable to other host-pathogen interactions.  In
     particular, identified functional control modules are likely to be shared
     across pathosystems.  The informatic and statistical methodologies and tools
     developed for the analysis and modeling efforts will be made widely available
     to both the plant and general scientific communities.  In addition, the
     intimate collaboration and cross-training of young mathematicians, engineers,
     and experimental biologists yields truly interdisciplinary scientists uniquely
     positioned to address biological questions using quantitative and systems-based
     approaches.<p></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
This research is a functional analysis of the xyloglucan 
endotransglucosylase/hydrolase (XTH) genes of the model plant 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i>. XTHs are capable of modifying xyloglucan, a major 
component of the plant cell wall, and yet the physiological 
functions of these enzymes are not understood. The wall is a 
fundamental structure of plant cells that controls cellular 
shape, size and integrity, and plays a role in signal 
transduction.  Enzymes that modify wall polysaccharides 
likely play critical roles in plant morphogenesis and 
physiology.
<p> A broad-based integrative approach will be taken to 
elucidate the biochemical and physiological functions of 
XTHs. Mutations within XTH genes will be sought and mutant 
phenotypes characterized with respect to growth, development 
and overall fitness, in addition to wall properties and 
ability to adapt to diverse environments.  Expression 
patterns of XTHs will be determined.  Reporter gene analyses 
will shed light on tissue, organ, and developmental 
specificity of expression.  Enzymes will be produced with 
heterologous systems and their properties, such as substrate 
preferences and reaction conditions, will be compared among 
the different isozymes. Completion of these experiments will 
improve concepts of how plant cell walls are formed, 
maintained and modified, and how these properties impact the 
overall fitness, development and physiology of plants.

</a> at Ohio State University for distribution to the 
community.  In addition, this research will enhance the 
infrastructure of research and training through the continued 
support and laboratory training of postdoctoral, graduate and 
undergraduate students.  The PI is committed to increasing 
the representation of women and underrepresented minorities 
in science.  Undergraduates will also participate in the 
scientific discovery process through Rice University 
laboratory courses. PCR-based screening methods and reporter 
gene expression analyses have been optimized such that 
undergraduates can contribute to research through lab 
courses.  The students supported by this grant will be

<blockquote>
Multiple tools will be required to understand the function of 
the 26,000 genes of the model plant 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i>. Discovering induced or natural variation in DNA 
sequences of interest greatly facilitates the analysis of 
each gene. The 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> TILLING Project (ATP) discovers, sequences and delivers 
mutations and polymorphisms (natural variations) in target 
genes ordered by 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> researchers. For each target locus ATP provides 
mutations using TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions In 
Genomes), a reverse genetics method that discovers induced 
point mutations in populations of chemically mutagenized 
individuals. The broad range of mutations possible by 
chemical mutagenesis can impair a gene with different 
severity, thus providing an allelic series useful in 
understanding function. In addition, for each target locus 
ATP queries 50 standard accessions for natural polymorphisms 
(Ecotilling). Natural variants will thus be available for 
phenotypic characterization. The first objective is to TILL 
and ecotill 180 genes per year. Orders can be entered by the 
public at the ATP site (
<a href="http://tilling.fhcrc.org/">
http://tilling.fhcrc.org/
</a>). The second objective is to provide to undergraduate 
students an 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i>-based educational tool on genomic research. An education 
link will be posted at the ATP site and will provide guided 
opportunities to explore gene function. Deliverables include 
TILLING lines, mutations and polymorphisms, all available for 
search and ordering at the TAIR Arabidpsis database site (
<a href="/">
www.arabidopsis.org
</a>, see "stocks", "sequence viewer" and 
"allele/polymorphisms"). The service provided by ATP will 
supplement the existing reverse genetics tools by providing 
an important additional technology, thus facilitating the 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> 2010 objective to understand the function of each gene. 
<p>Broader impact: In addition to enriching the teaching of 
the PIs and providing training opportunity for undergraduates 
at the University of Washington, this project has a specific 
plan to involve undergradues in 4-year institutions. In 
collaboration with instructors from four-year universities we 
are developing exercises for undergraduate teaching in which 
the relationship of candidate genes to selected phenotypes 
will be assessed by students using the genotyping and 
targeted mutations resources of ATP. The genomic resources 
developed over the past decade in 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> will be integrated into these exercises. Therefore, ATP 
will provide a conduit through which undergraduate students 
in small four-year institutions can participate in 
postgenomic research.

<blockquote>
Sphingolipids have been demonstrated to play important roles 
as both membrane components and as signaling molecules 
involved in regulating cellular processes in animals and 
fungi.  While sphingolipids are quantitatively important 
components of specific plant membranes and recent evidence 
indicates that sphingolipids serve as signaling molecules in 
plants, surprisingly little is known about plant sphingolipid 
function. This 2010 project focuses on the network of genes 
predicted to be involved in sphingolipid metabolism.  Further 
information about the project including a list of the 
specific genes to be investigated is available at 
<a href="http://bio.usuhs.mil/2010.html">
http://bio.usuhs.mil/2010.html
</a>.  These genes will be identified and the functions of 
the encoded proteins (e.g., the specific reaction catalyzed 
by the gene product, its substrate specificity, subcellular 
location, expression and activity in tissues) will be 
determined. The specific roles of different sphingolipids in 
plants will be determined by characterizing the properties 
and behavior of mutant plants defective in specific 
sphingolipid metabolic genes and so incapable of synthesizing 
a given sphingolipid. This research will lead to an 
understanding of the role of sphingolipids in plant growth 
and development as well as the response of plants to biotic 
and abiotic stresses.  This project will not only result in a 
profound increase in our understanding of the metabolism and 
function of plant sphingolipids per se, but it is anticipated 
that these efforts will also intersect with other 2010 
projects focusing on signaling, disease resistance and 
glycosyltransferases. While the major results of the work 
will be published in scientific journals and presented at 
meetings, regular updates of progress and abstracts of 
published work and meetings presentations will be posted at 
the web address given above to facilitate information 
sharing. This collaborative effort involves five 
investigators at distinctly different institutions with the 
complementary expertise to successfully accomplish this work. 
All facets of this effort will involve post-doctoral 
associates, graduate students, undergraduates and high school 
students and it is expected that these individuals will 
develop an appreciation for the benefits of collaborative 
research.

<blockquote>
The proposed study pertains to the development of research 
tools and resources for the plant biology community. The 
elucidation of the DNA sequence of the 125-Mb 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> genome revealed the presence of approximately 25,000 
genes using various computational approaches. In order for 
this vast amount of information to be useful, a more precise 
understanding of each of the transcriptional units is 
required. To fulfill this need, we initiated an ORFeome 
project to obtain clones for each protein coding open-
reading-frame (ORF) in 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i>. The project goals were to experimentally verify the 
annotation and construct full-length ORF clones for 10,500 of 
the 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> genes. This study resulted in the experimental 
verification of 30% of the annotated genes and revealed that 
the current genome annotation is only 68% correct. In 
addition, the project produced a set of 10,500 publically 
available ORF clones for plant functional and proteomics 
studies. The immediate near term goal of this two-year 2010 
project is to experimentally verify the annotation of an 
additional 3,330 genes by full-length cDNA sequencing and the 
construction/sequencing of 3,333 additional ORF clones for 
new transcriptional units. We will focus on genes that are 
known to be transcribed, so called "annotated expressed 
genes" but for which full-length ORF clones are not 
available.  ORFs will be constructed using RT-PCR and they 
will be subcloned into universal recombination vector system. 
Transcription unit sequence information will be deposited in 
GenBank and displayed on our web accessible database (
<a href="http://signal.salk.edu/">
http://signal.salk.edu
</a>).  Clones produced by the project will be deposited with the 
<a href="http://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/%7Eplantbio/Facilities/abrc/abrchome.htm">
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> Biological Resource Center
</a> at Ohio State University. We will coordinate with 
researchers in the US, Europe and Japan to maximize the rate 
at which new genes become available to the public.
<p> Broader Impacts: The resources developed by this project 
will be widely available to a large number of researchers and 
will provide the basis for a wide variety of projects that 
rely upon whole genome information. An important feature of 
this proposal is that all of the ORF clones and sequences 
will be made freely available to the research community as 
soon as they are produced. The beneficiaries of this program 
will be the entire plant biology community as both the 
sequence information and the clones will provide plant 
biologists with essential reagents necessary to elucidate the 
functions of the 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> proteome. Another important feature of the project is 
the training of undergraduate students in bioinformatics and 
genomic methodologies. The completion of the proposed 
research will provide an important resource to the plant 
biology community, enabling a variety of future research 
endeavors such as whole genome protein arrays and the rapid 
creation of plants that ectopically express any cDNA that is 
regulated using any promoter of choice. The long-term impact 
of these enabling tools and technologies on agriculture is 
expected to be profound, providing fundamental knowledge for 
the construction of new plant species with superior agronomic 
traits.

<blockquote>
As plants grow, they coordinate their development and 
environmental responses by exchanging information using small 
gene products called signaling molecules. The goal of this 
research is to determine the biological functions of 25 CLE 
genes that encode a family of related signaling molecules in 
<i>Arabidopsis thaliana
</i>.  One CLE gene product, called CLV3, communicates 
information between cells at the growing shoot tips of 
plants, but the functions of the other CLE signaling 
molecules are unknown.  Information on where each CLE gene 
acts in the plant, and on analysis of experimental plants in 
which each CLE gene function is either impaired or 
artificially enhanced will be delivered through a public 
database developed for this project (
<a href="http://www.pgec.usda.gov/Fletcher/CLEproject.html">
www.pgec.usda.gov/Fletcher/CLEproject.html
</a>).  These gene function data will consist of qualitative 
and quantitative measurements of root, shoot, leaf and flower 
development and environmental responses.  The investigators 
will provide CLE clones and experimental plants without cost 
for other researchers to use in further experiments, and the 
research results will be communicated widely and in a timely 
fashion through meeting presentations and scientific 
publications. The CLE genes encode completely novel signaling 
molecules, and thus their analysis will be essential to reach 
the 2010 Project goal to determine the function of all 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> genes.  Further, because plant growth and survival is 
critically dependent on the communication of information 
between cells, and because so little is known about the 
signaling molecules that convey this information, 
understanding CLE gene functions should provide fundamental 
new insights into how plants develop and respond to their 
environment.
<p> An important component of the project is to integrate 
research and education to increase the general understanding 
of how cell-to-cell communication works. Postdoctoral 
associates as well as University of California at Berkeley 
and Caltech graduate students will be trained.  Undergraduate 
students from these same institutions, including those from 
underrepresented groups will be enlisted to receive training 
in modern functional genomics theory and methods, which can 
be applied to a wide variety of biological systems.  All 
graduate students and postdocs will assist in various aspects 
of the research, including the supervision of undergraduates, 
providing valuable training not only in science but also in 
mentoring.

<blockquote>
The polyadenylation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) is an important 
step in the process of gene expression in plants.  
Polyadenylation adds an essential element to the mRNA and 
helps to coordinate the synthesis of a messenger RNA with its 
ultimate functioning in protein synthesis.  Consequently, the 
protein subunits that make up the polyadenylation machinery 
are expected to play important roles in plant growth.  The 
goals of this project are to determine the collective 
function of the set of 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> genes that encode subunits of the polyadenylation 
machinery (this set, including 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> genome identifiers, can be found at 
<a href="http://www.uky.edu/%7Eaghunt00/polyA2010.html">
http://www.uky.edu/~aghunt00/polyA2010.html
</a> and 
<a href="http://www.users.muohio.edu/liq/arabidopsis2010.html">
http://www.users.muohio.edu/liq/arabidopsis2010.html
</a>).  This will include a documentation of the phenotypes 
of plants that have had one or more subunit removed (by 
mutation or gene silencing) and a determination of the 
complete set of protein-protein interactions involving the 
various subunits.  The results will be disseminated via peer-
reviewed publication as well as through web pages managed by 
the principal investigators (
<a href="http://www.uky.edu/%7Eaghunt00/polyA2010.html">
http://www.uky.edu/~aghunt00/polyA2010.html
</a> and 
<a href="http://www.users.muohio.edu/liq/arabidopsis2010.html">
http://www.users.muohio.edu/liq/arabidopsis2010.html
</a>).  In addition, mutant 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> stocks will be deposited with the appropriate stock 
center(s). The research will contribute to a goal of the 2010 
Project ("to determine the function of all genes of a 
reference species within their cellular, organismal and 
evolutionary contexts by the year 2010") by cataloguing 
mutant phenotypes, by defining the network of interactions 
amongst 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> polyadenylation factor subunits, and by identifying 
proteins of unknown function that interact with the 
polyadenylation machinery.
<p> The research will greatly increase the current 
understanding of mRNA 3' end formation in higher plants.  As 
such, it will enhance the ability to tailor foreign genes for 
expression in transgenic plants, and thereby develop improved 
crops (as well as novel alternative economic opportunities) 
for farmers.  It will also lend significant insight into the 
evolution of mRNA polyadenylation.  The research products 
(cloned cDNA, antibodies, plant lines etc.) will be made 
available to the research community at large.  The research 
will contribute to the training of two postdoctoral scholars, 
four graduate students, and as many as twelve undergraduates.  
The latter will be drawn from highly-regarded and diverse 
programs at the University of Kentucky and Miami University.

<blockquote>
An array-based genotyping method will be developed as a tool 
for 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> researchers. The current rate-limiting step or mapping 
mutations in F2 populations and for creating genetic maps of 
recombinant inbred line populations is that large numbers of 
individual plants need to be genotyped using several hundred 
genetic markers. Array-based genotyping permits the 
simultaneous assessment of many molecular markers, suggesting 
this approach as a rapid and cost-effective genotyping 
method. Spotted oligonucleotide glass slide microarrays that 
can be used to detect approximately 500 insertion/deletion 
differences (InDel) between the Columbia and Landsberg erecta 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> accessions will be produced. Once they have been 
developed, printed oligonucleotide arrays will be made 
available to the 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> research community at cost. The DNA sequences of the 
informative oligonucleotides, marker data for recombinant 
inbred lines used to test the arrays, and information for 
ordering printed arrays will be published on the project web 
site (
<a href="http://bti.cornell.edu/jander/mapping_array">
http://bti.cornell.edu/jander/mapping_array
</a>). Publicly available genotyping arrays will promote the 
goals of the 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> 2010 program by facilitating the rapid identification of 
genes based on mutant phenotypes. Student education is an 
important aspect of this project, and well-defined array 
experiments will provide excellent undergraduate research 
opportunities. In addition, this novel genotyping approach 
can be applied to other organisms with genomes that are too 
complex for efficient genotyping using currently available 
array-based methods.

<blockquote>
Plastid division in plants is orchestrated by a complex 
macromolecular apparatus, the components of which are mostly 
unknown. The functions of a set of predicted and genetically 
defined 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> gene products likely to participate in plastid division 
will be determined. The proteins to be investigated derive 
from three sources: 1) predicted proteins having sequence or 
structural homology to known plastid division, bacterial cell 
division, mitochondrial fission or fusion, or microtubule-
based motor proteins; 2) genes defined by the 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> arc (accumulation and replication of chloroplasts) 
mutants; and 3) genes encoding proteins with homology to 
cyanobacterial cell division proteins, to be identified by 
transposon mutagenesis in Synechococcus PCC 7942. Functional 
studies will include examination of knockout lines by 
microscopy for abnormalities in chloroplast number, size, 
shape, ultrastructure and FtsZ localization pattern, 
biochemical assays of protein targeting and topology, 
analysis of in vivo localization using GFP fusion proteins 
and protein-specific antibodies, and analysis of protein 
interactions using immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid 
techniques. The results obtained from functional 
investigations will be integrated to arrive at a model 
describing the macromolecular organization and biochemical 
activity of the chloroplast division complex from which new 
hypotheses can be derived and tested. This research will be 
relevant to scientists interested in a variety of biological 
problems, including organelle fission and dynamics, 
macromolecular organization, organelle evolution, and plant 
development. cDNA clones, plasmids, antibodies and other 
useful reagents generated during these studies will be made

knockout and arc mutant phenotypes. Database annotations will 
be revised as new information is obtained. In addition to 
providing training opportunities to graduate students and

<blockquote>
The 
<i>Arabidopsis thaliana
</i> genome contains 24 related genes that encode 
methyltransferase enzymes distinct from any other known 
methyltransferases. One methyltransferase from this group has 
been shown to convert jasmonic acid, an important plant 
hormone, into the jasmonate methyl ester, thereby changing 
the activity of the hormone in significant ways. Preliminary 
experiments suggest that the other 23 methyltransferases of 
this group convert several important hormones and other plant 
constituents into the methyl esters, thereby exerting 
important effects on the biological activity of these 
molecules and consequently on myriad important physiological 
processes. The aim of this project is to identify the 
function of all the methyltransferases of this group (i.e., 
which compound each of them methylates) by a combination of 
methods that involve molecular genetics, enzymology, protein 
structure analysis, and metabolite profiling. The 
consequences of the methylation of such hormonal molecules on 
the physiology of the plant will be examined in selected 
cases, which may include processes involving plant response 
to pathogens, drought conditions, and herbivory. The results 
are expected to provide a better understanding of plant 
responses to environmental conditions, thus helping improve 
crop yield and nutritional value. In addition, by developing 
methodologies for determining which 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> genes are involved in the synthesis of the plant's 
diverse repertoire of small molecules, the project will 
contribute to the elucidation of the function of other 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> genes involved in hitherto unknown biochemical pathways.
<p> Broader Impact: The project will provide 
interdisciplinary opportunities for training undergraduates, 
graduates, and post-docs, including women and minorities. All 
three institutions involved in this project have formal 
programs to attract minority undergraduate and high school 
students to faculty labs, and such students will be actively 
recruited. In addition, methods and materials developed in 
this investigation will be used directly to train 
undergraduate students in formal lab courses taught by the 
lead investigators. The resources generated in the project 
will be made available through the

<blockquote>
Studies of the molecular bases of plant responses to enemies 
have focused more on microbes than on insects, despite the 
great ecological, evolutionary, and economic impacts of 
herbivores.  Research on plant responses to insects has been 
limited mainly to phenotypic (chemical) defenses.  Little 
attempt has been made to link molecular and chemical 
responses to either type of pest to understand the mechanisms 
underlying plant defense.
<p> This project will employ microarrays of approximately 
2500 stress-responsive genes (developed by a previous NSF 
Plant Genome project) plus critical genes in the 
glucosinolate biosynthetic pathway.  Gene expression and 
glucosinolate profiles will be developed for plants 
responding to insect species and pathogens representing 
chewing and sucking feeding types and a range of 
specialization on Brassicaceae.  The major goal of this 
limited proof-of-concept project is to demonstrate that gene 
function can be inferred by using multivariate statistical 
treatments to link array results to defense metabolite 
response profiles and to ecological outcomes.  "Gene 
function" in terms of defense will be inferred in terms of 
expression pattern in relation to known functions (e.g., in 
signaling pathways, metabolite synthesis) and in the context 
of the ecological outcome (e.g., impact on insect, resistance 
to herbivory) using standard multivariate clustering 
techniques, concordance analysis, and Mantel covariate 
statistics.  Identities and functions of critical components 
of plant defense responses identified statistically will 
eventually be confirmed using mutants and knockouts in 
bioassays with specific insects and microbes under varying 
environmental conditions. Images of expression patterns, 
metabolite profile data, integrative results, protocol 
updates, and instructions for obtaining material will be 
posted monthly at the following

determining the functions of genes in the context of plant 
defense, producing a stress microarray and chemical 
analytical protocols as tools useful to a wide range of 
investigators, and developing statistical protocols molecular 
ecologists can use to link genotypic and phenotypic 
responses.  In addition, the project will be coordinated with

</p><p>Broader impacts of the limited project will include 
training 3 graduate students, exploiting existing K-12, 
teacher, and undergraduate research experience links that 
already exist in the PSU College of Agricultural Sciences and

<blockquote>
The complete genome sequence of 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> has revealed a large number of novel genes, however DNA 
sequence alone offers few clues as to their specific 
functions. Currently, much effort is being devoted toward 
studying gene function and expression. Although important, 
these studies are not sufficient to predict the structure, 
function, and activity of proteins in the cell. Proteomics, 
the global analysis of proteins, is emerging as an important 
area of research. In this pilot project, a small collection 
of expression clones of 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> open reading frames will be generated. Using this 
collection, optimal protein expression systems will be 
developed to produce and purify 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> proteins. The proteins will be printed to generate pilot 
protein chips, which will then be screened for various 
biochemical assays, including protein-protein interaction 
assays, protein-DNA/RNA interactions, protein-phospholipids 
interactions and the identification of substrates for kinases 
and other enzymes.<p> Broader Impacts: The rapid progress in 
the field of large-scale biology has provided the opportunity 
to understand the function of biological networks as a whole. 
Since the biochemical function of a gene is manifested 
through its encoded protein, recently much emphasis has been 
devoted to the development of new tools for proteomics. 
Therefore, this project will ultimately provide an enormous 
valuable resource to the scientific community for a variety 
of applications aimed at the high-throughput study of protein 
function in 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i>. The advantage of proteome chips is that a comprehensive 
set of individual proteins can be directly screened 
<i>in vitro
</i> for a wide variety of activities. Furthermore, once the 
proteins are prepared, proteome screening is significantly 
faster and cheaper than other methods. The reagents and 
information generated from this project will be available to 
the scientific community (
<a href="http://bioinfo.mbb.yale.edu/genome/plant">
http://bioinfo.mbb.yale.edu/genome/plant
</a>) on a regular basis and are expected to significantly 
enhance the analysis of protein function in 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i>.

<blockquote>
The proposed research will identify and determine functions 
of gametophytic genes in 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i>.  A mutant screen for gametophytic mutations using Ds 
insertion lines will be performed,  resulting in the 
identification of an estimated 400 gametophytic mutants.  The 
genes disrupted by these insertions will be identified by 
sequence and posted on a website at UC Davis (
<a href="http://www-plb.ucdavis.edu/Labs/sundar/">
http://www-plb.ucdavis.edu/Labs/sundar/
</a>). Characterization of gene function will be carried out 
through integrated genetic, cellular and developmental study 
of the female and male gametophytes in the mutants.  The 
characterized mutants will be made publicly available through 
deposition in the 
<a href="http://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/%7Eplantbio/Facilities/abrc/abrchome.htm">
ABRC
</a> stock center. In addition, we will use expression 
profiling to identify female gametophyte-specific genes.  
Relatively little is known about the genes and functions 
required for gametophytic development in flowering plants. 
The aim of the 2010 project to determine the functions of all 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> genes will require the identification and characterization of gametophytic genes, which play a critical 
role in plant reproduction. These studies will also yield 
potential applications towards the control of reproduction in 
crop plants.
<p> Broader Impact:  The project will provide comprehensive 
training in plant biology research for postdoctoral fellows, 
graduate students and undergraduate students at both 
participating institutions.  Efforts will be made to recruit 
individuals from underrepresented groups to participate in 
this project.  In the case of undergraduate students, the PIs 
will work with specific programs at their institutions 
intended for the purpose of encouraging minority 
participation  in research.  In addition, participants in the 
project will be involved in outreach efforts to schools 
through the attachment of high school students and through 
workshop modules in middle schools.

<blockquote>
The genome of the model plant 
<i>Arabidopsis thaliana
</i> has been annotated to show the presence of close to 
30,000 genes. Many of these genes are both predicted by 
computer programs and supported by experimental evidence ' 
their similarity to characterized genes from plants, animals 
and microbes. However, 15-20% of the gene annotations are 
based only on computer evidence. In addition, comparison of 
the 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> genome sequence with its close relative 
<i>Brassica oleracea
</i> (the cabbage/cauliflower/Brussels sprouts family) 
reveals many regions of sequence conservation that are not at 
present annotated as genes. Preliminary experimental analysis 
of some of these regions indicates that a significant 
fraction do encode genes that have so far been unrecognized 
by the annotation process. Full-length cDNAs provide both the 
basis for greatly improved gene structure annotation by 
alignment of their sequences with genomic DNA, and also the 
reagents with which to analyze their function by expression 
and other kinds of analysis. The objective of this research 
is to generate full-length cDNAs for approximately 2,000 of 
these genes that represent the least well-understood genes in 
the genome. We will use 5' and 3' RACE to define the precise 
structure of each gene and then generate full-length cDNA 
clones for protein-coding genes (ORFs) in a recombination 
vector suitable for functional studies by the research 
community. We will generate clones and sequence at a rate of 
approximately 100 clones per month within three months of the 
start of the project with a goal of producing 2,000 novel and 
previously uncharacterized clones over the period of the 
project. Sequences of the clones will be submitted to GenBank 
as they are generated and will also be available from the 
TIGR ftp site. The clones themselves will be made freely 
available to the research community through the 
<a href="http://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/%7Eplantbio/Facilities/abrc/abrchome.htm">
ABRC
</a>. Details of the project will be maintained at a project-
specific web site, <a href="http://www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/ath1/2010_cDNAs">
http://www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/ath1/2010_cDNAs
</a>. At the scientific level, this project will enhance the 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> genome annotation by increasing the total gene count in 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> by ~10% and will be a major step towards completing the 
identification and validation of all the genes in the first 
fully sequenced plant genome 
<i>Arabidopsis thaliana
</i>. The cDNAs will be available as community resources. 
Integrated into the proposed research is a curriculum 
development component that will provide research experience 
to high school science educators in which they will work on 
the project and use project materials for the development of 
new curricular modules designed to provide exposure to 
fundamental concepts in plant genomics to high school 
students.

distribute antisera to 39 NTME proteins, (2) develop methods 
to express and assay plant NTMEs, (3) synthesize novel 
combinatorial peptide libraries for determining the extended 
specificities of NTMEs, and (4) produce a collection of 
homozygous single and double mutants for NTMEs. The 
interactive NTME web site (
<a href="http://www.cepceb.ucr.edu/members/2010/NTMEs.htm">
http://www.cepceb.ucr.edu/members/2010/NTMEs.htm
</a>) will provide a list of the 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> NTME genes, NTME assays, links to the peptidase and 
transferase research communities, and mechanisms to access 
the resources developed by this project. The 
<a href="http://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/%7Eplantbio/Facilities/abrc/abrchome.htm">
ABRC
</a> will distribute mutants generated in this project. In 
addition to establishing the first biochemical rules to 
predict the fate of a protein in a subcellular compartment, 
this program provides a unique opportunity to train 
undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in 
a newly emerging field of N-terminal modifying enzymes in 
plants.

<blockquote>
The initiation of flowering is a critical developmental 
decision in the plant life cycle. A common environmental cue 
used by many plant species to initiate flowering during the 
proper season is the change of day-length (photoperiod). The 
perception of photoperiod relies upon the circadian clock. 
Genetical studies over the past two decades indicate that a  
significant fraction of the genome is involved in flowering-
time control. Our project goal is to screen the collections 
of T-DNA insertion lines we have created for mutants that are 
early flowering in non-inductive photoperiods. These mutants 
will identify a set of genes involved in the biological 
function of daylength perception and the circadian rhythm 
network.  Our preliminary results indicate that many of these 
genes will be unique to the plant genome (i.e., no obvious 
homologs in animals or fungi) and that large-scale forward 
genetic screens are the most efficient way to identify these 
plant-specific genes. This area of research holds much 
promise for the discovery of novel plant genes and gene 
families, and in the long term will contribute to 
understanding the intimate link between the circadian clock 
and photoperiod perception at a molecular level. Given the 
central role of the timing of flowering in crop productivity, 
our work may also provide strategies to manipulate flowering 
to enhance crop yields.
<p> Current information on the phenotypes, map location and 
gene identities of the mutants that we characterize will be 
available at

<blockquote>
The completed genome sequence of 
<i>Arabidopsis thaliana
</i> codes for at least 1,533 transcriptional regulators, of 
which the majority are predicted to bind DNA. Interactions 
between these DNA-binding proteins and cognate promoter 
sequences are primary determinants in establishing spatial 
and temporal expression patterns of batteries of genes that 
effect homeostasis, development and adaptation.  However, our 
present knowledge of target genes and regulatory networks for 
all but a few plant transcription factors remains rudimentary 
at best.  Considering the challenge ahead, efforts to assign 
gene-regulatory functions to the relatively large number of 
uncharacterized transcription factors of this higher plant by 
2010 will strongly benefit from more global and high-
throughput approaches.  In this regard, this 2010 Project 
award will make use of a complementary and integrated 
strategy, involving high-throughput plant chromatin 
immunoprecipitation (pChIP) and gene expression analysis, for 
mapping transcriptional regulatory networks of 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i>.  Additional parallel experiments are planned to assess 
the functional validity of findings.  The focus of study is 
the TGA family of basic/leucine-zipper proteins, which 
comprise a complex transcriptional system with important 
regulatory functions in development and defense.  A key 
question to be answered here is the identity of primary 
target genes and their associated networks.  Data from this 
project will be posted periodically under links to be 
established on TIGR (
<a href="http://www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/ath1/">
http://www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/ath1/
</a>) and CAB (
<a href="http://www.umbi.umd.edu/%7Ecbr/nsf2010.htm">
http://www.umbi.umd.edu/~cab/ 
</a>) websites.  Methodologies and tools to be developed 
under this award will include a high-throughput pChIP 
technology and partial genome array of intergenic sequences, 
which will be made publicly available as they come on line 
during the 3 year time-line of this project.  In addition to 
developing a new paradigm for understanding transcriptional 
control mechanisms in 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i>, this project will promote education and training 
missions that are encouraged by NSF. The goal of this 2010 
project award is to identify and categorize gene-regulatory 
interactions that occur between a subset of DNA-binding 
proteins and the genes that they govern in the living plant. 
Expression of these genes is implicated in defense responses 
by plants to infection and toxins.  Thus, this work will not 
only provide important new information on the mechanistic 
basis of how genes are regulated, but also may benefit 
agriculture by leading to new environmentally-friendly 
strategies for genetically enhancing natural protective genes 
of crop plants.

<blockquote>
Transcription factor networks are the genetic blueprint by 
which plants and other organisms orchestrate the proper 
activation and timing of gene expression. A first step in 
deciphering transcriptional networks is to determine the 
expression pattern of all genes at cell-type resolution. To 
accomplish this goal, this research project will develop a 
new genomics approach, which involves sorting cells from 
transgenic lines in which a fluorescent protein is used as a 
cell-specific marker. The sorted cell populations will then 
be used as a source of RNA that is hybridized to microarrays. 
The project focuses on genes expressed in the 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> root, which is a tractable model because of its simple 
and highly organized structure. The gene networks in question 
will be primarily those that involve DNA-binding 
transcription factors. The regulatory regions of these genes 
will be fused to fluorescent proteins to determine the 
ability of these sequences to confer tissue-specific 
expression. In addition, translational fusions of the same 
DNA binding factors will be made, enabling an analysis of 
post-transcriptional events that affect protein localization. 
Bioinformatics tools will be developed that refine expression 
patterns based on multiple sources of data. These analysis 
tools will be made available through links at the Benfey lab 
website (
<a href="http://www.biology.duke.edu/benfeylab/at2010.html">
http://www.biology.duke.edu/benfeylab/at2010.html
</a>) at Duke University. The list of all transcription 
factors with their root cell-type specific expression 
profiles will be made available in regular updates of this 
site. Thus, the research will determine the specific 
expression domains of a vast number of genes, which is an 
important first step in determining gene function. The 
research will also provide the input for emerging analysis 
tools that can decipher the controls of gene regulation based 
on detailed expression patterns. This will help establish the 
function of transcription factors in terms of how they affect 
the transcription of other genes. To harness the power of 
gene function discoveries, it is critical to find ways to 
gain greater control over the expression of genes. Targeted 
modification of gene expression is likely to be one of the 
most important ways to improve plant performance. This 
research will identify a large number of genes with highly 
specific expression patterns whose specific regulatory "code" 
will be of significant use in many areas of plant research 
and improvement. The detailed information on where and when 
many genes are expressed and the proteins that control their 
expression will help advance the understanding of how all 
plants control their growth and development. Another 
important part of the project will be to train the next 
generation of scientists to integrate computational 
approaches into plant biology. Graduate and undergraduate 
students will participate actively in the research. Duke and 
NYU have very diverse student populations with excellent 
representation of minority and women students. The PIs also 
will participate actively in outreach efforts such as 
programs for local high school teachers.

<blockquote>
The goal of this project is to determine the biological 
functions of a newly recognized class of 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> regulatory molecules - the small RNAs.  The small RNAs 
typically contain 20-25 nucleotides and are likely generated 
by a dsRNA-specific, RNaseIII-like mechanism.  Recently, 125 
small RNAs were identified in 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i>.  Several arise from sequences in known or predicted 
protein-coding genes and transposons.  The vast majority, 
however, arise from intergenic sequences between conventional 
genes.  The 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> small RNAs resemble small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) 
associated with RNA silencing and small temporal RNAs 
(stRNAs) associated with translational control in 
<i>C. elegans
</i>.  These 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> RNAs are proposed to function in posttranscriptional 
regulation of gene and mRNA activity by several mechanisms, 
including RNA silencing, translational interference and 
epigenetic mechanisms in the nucleus.  New libraries of small 
RNAs will be prepared using different tissues, a database of 
small RNA information will be assembled, and the small RNA 
sequences will be deposited into GenBank (
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
</a>).  The function of small RNAs from protein-coding genes 
in posttranscriptional RNA silencing, and the function of 
small RNAs from intergenic regions in translational control 
and modification of nuclear DNA will be determined. Finally, 
the roles of each of nine RNaseIII-like proteins in small RNA 
biosynthesis will be analyzed.  Results will be shared in 
peer-reviewed journals, at the  International Conference on 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> Research, and on a database of small RNA information.  
The database, which will include capabilities for searching 
small RNA map positions, information about nearest genes, 
whether or not a given gene is near a small RNA, and other 
interactive features and results, will be made web-accessible 
to the scientific community (
<a href="http://cgrb.orst.edu/smallRNA/">
http://cgrb.orst.edu/smallRNA/
</a>).  The publicly accessible database of small RNA 
information will have broad impact by providing researchers 
with information about small RNAs near or within genes of 
interest and allowing subsequent experiments on the roles of 
small RNA-based regulation of the 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> genome. Genes are controlled by many different 
mechanisms. Recently, a new type of regulatory system 
involving an unusual class of small RNA molecules was 
discovered.  The small RNAs are proposed to function by 
binding to messenger RNA from specific gene targets.  The 
small RNA would then trigger either cleavage of messenger RNA 
or inhibit the function of the messenger RNA to which it is 
bound.   This project will result in discovery of new types 
of small RNA molecules and determine how these regulators 
affect gene expression in the model plant, 
<i>Arabidopsis thaliana
</i>.

<blockquote>
Sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins containing the novel 
WRKY zinc finger motifs are a recently identified superfamily 
of transcription factors found only in plants.  The few cases 
where functional studies are conducted indicate that WRKY 
proteins play important roles in various biological processes 
unique to plants, including disease resistance, senescence, 
seed germination and trichome development.  This project is 
aimed at determining the functions of 72 identified 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> WRKY genes at three different levels.  First, the 
expression patterns of the 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> WRKY genes will be determined during plant growth, development and responses to biotic and abiotic stress 
conditions.  Secondly, both loss-of-function mutants (RNAi 
and knockout mutants) and constitutive expressing gain-of-
function mutants for the WRKY genes will be produced and 
analyzed for altered phenotypes in growth, development and 
responses to environmental conditions.  Thirdly, interacting 
proteins for all expressed 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> WRKY proteins will be identified in order to understand 
the molecular mechanisms by which individual WRKY proteins 
achieve their in vivo regulatory specificity.  Progress in 
these studies will lead to a comprehensive understanding of 
the biological functions and molecular activities of plant 
WRKY proteins.  These studies will also provide general tools 
and approaches useful for functional analysis of large gene 
families, particularly those encoding DNA-binding 
transcription factors.  Sequence and expression information 
of the WRKY gene family will be made immediately available 
through Genbank, publications and the project website (
<a href="http://www.btny.purdue.edu/WRKY/">
http://www.btny.purdue.edu/WRKY/
</a>).  The website will also be updated with experimental 
data on functional analysis of each WRKY gene as it becomes 
available.
<p> The knowledge obtained from the project will enhance our 
understanding of the molecular basis for various important 
plant biological processes in which WRKY proteins are 
involved and provide potential targets for improving 
important agronomic traits in crop plants.

<blockquote>
This pilot project will develop a high-throughput strategy to 
analyze native expression patterns and subcellular 
localization of 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> gene products of unknown function. This strategy, 
Fluorescent Tagging of Full-Length Proteins (FTFLP), will 
comprise five major steps: (1) Selection of "functionally 
unassigned" 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> genes and prediction of their protein structure and 
suitable site for fluorescent tag insertion (2) Amplification 
of each gene in two parts, with the junction between the two 
parts corresponding to our chosen insertion site for the 
fluorescent tag(3) Introduction of the fluorescent tag, 
yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) using a triple overlap PCR 
approach (4) Insertion of PCR products into binary vectors 
(5) Production of transgenic 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> lines and analysis of expression pattern and 
intracellular localization for each tagged protein. As a 
pilot approach, the project aims to analyze a statistically 
significant number of genes to support the applicability to a 
subsequent wider study. To this end, approximately 800 genes 
(listed at the already operational project website 
<a href="/portals/masc/proteintagging.html">
http://arabidopsis.org/portals/masc/proteintagging.html
</a>) were selected from a total of ca. 8,000 unknown genes. 
This pilot list was chosen based on the following 
sequentially-applied criteria: 1) have matching full-length 
cDNA, 2) are annotated as 'unknown protein' or 'putative 
protein', and 3) do not have any Gene Ontology annotations. 
The selected genes reflect the diversity of all the unknown 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> genes with respect to plant specificity, predicted 
domain and/or gene family information, and availability of 
matching full-length cDNA sequences. FTFLP as a tool for 
functional proteomics offers three significant advantages: it 
focuses on genes of unknown function, it produces internally-
tagged full length proteins that are more likely to exhibit 
faithful intracellular localization, and it utilizes native 
promoters to allow us to determine tissue specificity. Three 
deliverables will be offered to the research community: 1) 
Expression vectors harboring full-length sequences for each 
gene under its native promoter and tagged with YFP flanked by 
unique restriction sites, 2) 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> transgenic lines expressing each construct, and 3) A 
website and a searchable database containing information 
about the lines and constructs, including the gene sequences 
highlighted with positions of primers and tagging sites, 
vector construct information, images and text descriptions of 
the protein expression pattern and intracellular 
localization, and protocols and standard operation procedures 
in experimentation, analysis, and interpretation. Also, a 
Reference Protein Subcellular Localization Map will be 
constructed using fluorescently-tagged proteins with known 
intracellular targeting. These resources will be available to 
the public through two unrestricted venues: DNA constructs 
and transgenic seeds will be distributed through the 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> Biological Resource Center (
<a href="http://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/%7Eplantbio/Facilities/abrc/abrchome.htm">
ABRC
</a>) whereas gene sequences and expression and subcellular 
localization data, including fluorescence microscopy images, 
will be disseminated via the project website integrated into 
<a href="/">
The 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> Information Resource (TAIR)
</a>. Importantly, this sharing of the resources and results 
of this project through 
<a href="http://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/%7Eplantbio/Facilities/abrc/abrchome.htm">
ABRC
</a> and 
<a href="/">
TAIR
</a>, respectively, will take place on a continuous basis as 
the deliverables become available. Announcements on the 
availability of new resources will be made through such 
electronic media as the Bionet USENET newsgroups and parallel 
e-mail lists. This project significantly advances the overall 
objectives of the 2010 Project by characterizing on a large 
scale the expression and subcellular localization of unknown 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> genes. Our understanding of 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> biology will be glaringly incomplete without such 
knowledge. In addition, this project has a broader impact on 
the society and science. Once this pilot project demonstrates 
the feasibility of the proposed approach, it will serve a 
basis for developing a laboratory curriculum for use in cell 
biology training of high school students and teachers as well 
as beginning investigators at the CSHL DNA Learning Center 
and the annual 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> Molecular Genetics Course, and at the biannual UCR Plant 
Cell Biology course. Finally, a teaching outreach program 
with community colleges will involve undergraduates in summer 
research. Thus, our program will bridge genomic approaches 
with cell biology in the laboratory and classroom, and 
generate important novel information and tools to 
characterize the 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> proteome.

<blockquote>
Post-transcriptional processing of mRNA is an important 
mechanism of gene regulation.  This project is concerned with 
3'-processing of mRNA, a process that includes cleavage of 
the precursor RNA sequence and subsequent polyadenylation.  
3'-processing sites are determined by cis-acting signal 
elements, short control sequences within the immature 
precursor mRNA.  The signals in yeast have been well 
characterized, but those in 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> have only begun to identify the precise sequence and 
positioning characteristics of the required cis-elements.
<p> Alternative 3'-processing of a specific mRNA, similar to 
alternative splicing, is a mechanism for regulating the 
sequence of the mature mRNA.  Unlike alternative splicing, 
however, alternative 3'-processing typically changes only the 
3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the mRNA, leaving the 
protein coding sequence unaltered.  Variation of the 3'-UTR 
sequence results in altered regulatory elements specific to 
the 3'-UTR, such as mRNA stability, translation, or 
localization elements.  The specific goals of this are 
project are: (1) establishment of a curated database of 
experimentally determined 3'-processing sites for 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i>, (2) construction of a discrete state-space model (DSM) 
based predictive tool for 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> mRNA 3'-processing sites, and (3) creation of a freely 
accessible web server interface to both the database and the 
predictive tools.  DSM models are a form of Hidden Markov 
Models (HMM), in which the model structure is manually, 
rather than automatically, designed.  DSM based models have 
previously been used to predict 3'-processing sites in the 
yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which has 3'-processing 
control elements similar to those found in plants.
</p><p> Public access to predictive tools will make it possible 
for external researchers to analyze any gene or group of 
genes of interest, even in the absence of experimentally 
determined sites in the curated database.  Prediction of 
3'-processing sites can also be coupled with gene prediction 
software to make the prediction more complete, including 
probable 3'-UTR sequences.  The web site is:

<blockquote>
Plant growth, development, and survival depend on the uptake, 
translocation, and sorting of 15 essential nutrients and 
countless metabolites to specific organs, cells and 
intracellular compartments.  However, it is not known how 
plants regulate and coordinate the complex network of long-
distance and cellular transport patterns.  The first complete 
genome sequence of a plant, large mutant collections, and 
extensive databases provide opportunities to generate new 
resources and tools to discover the functions of ~800 
transporters in 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i>.  The bulk of unknown transporters are secondary active 
transporters.  The major objectives of this project are to 
determine the ion specificity, the tissue and subcellular 
distribution, and the biological roles of 56 H+-coupled 
cation transporters, including the CaCA, CPA1, and CPA2 
families. With the availability of genomic sequence and the 
identification of transport homologs through bioinformatic 
analyses, heterologous expression in yeast will be used to 
quickly delineate the function of the entire complement of 
H+-coupled cation transporters.  Regulatory mechanisms will 
be determined by mutation of putative autoinhibitory domains.  
Transport in isolated membranes will be used to verify ion 
specificity of representative transporters.  Tissue and 
subcellular distribution will be determined using promoter-
reporter proteins expression in transgenic plants, and GFP-
tagged transporters in a protoplast model.  Biological and 
physiological functions of transporters will be analyzed 
using insertional knockout mutants.  New methods and

<blockquote>
An enhanced understanding of protein-protein interactions is 
important to the successful elucidation of multiprotein 
pathways, which mediate such vital processes as the response 
of cells to their environment, metabolic regulation, and 
development.  Alpha-helical scaffolding domains form extended 
surfaces for protein interactions by stacking together 
multiple small repeat units.  In this project, computer-
assisted bioinformatic techniques will be used to predict 
alpha helical scaffold domains encoded by the fully sequenced 
genome of the model plant 
<i>Arabidopsis thaliana
</i>.  Lines of mutant plants will then be obtained where 
these genes have been knocked out, and the effects of this 
change upon the function of the plants will be assessed by 
testing their growth, gene expression, and biochemical 
activity.  Proteins, which interact with these candidate 
scaffold domains, will be detected by their ability to bind 
to them in a yeast or bacterial protein interaction assay 
system.  The identified interaction proteins will then be 
analyzed by a similar series of computational and plant 
functional tests.  The goal of the 2010 Project is to 
discover the function of every encoded protein of 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> by that target date.  This project will provide the 
plant research community with an inventory of 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> scaffolding proteins, their protein interaction 
partners, functional hypotheses, and a set of characterized 
mutant seed stocks.  This project will be executed primarily 
by undergraduate students, who will receive hands on training 
in cutting edge research techniques.  More information can be

determined, and genetic models will be produced and 
characterized. To understand the molecular mechanism 
underlying PTP function, the in vivo substrates of PTPs will 
be identified using mass spectrometry. A useful database on 
phosphoproteome of 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> will be built and will be publicly accessible through 
PlantP website (
<a href="http://plantsp.sdsc.edu/">
http://plantsp.sdsc.edu/
</a>). The goal of this project is to understand the function 
and interplay of all tyrosine phosphatases in plant growth 
and developmental processes at both whole plant and molecular 
levels. Such information will contribute to the overall goal 
of 2010 program: to understand the function of all 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> genes.  This project will also integrate educational 
activities into the research program by establishing a summer 
workshop for high school biology teachers.

<blockquote>
This multidisciplinary collaborative research is aimed at 
determining how and why plants synthesize diverse 
triterpenoids.  This project will integrate reverse genetics 
in 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i>, heterologous expression of cDNAs in yeast, 
spectroscopic and chromatographic structural determination, 
and gene expression analysis to elucidate the function of 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> triterpenoid biosynthetic genes and thereby triterpenoid 
biosynthetic pathways, control mechanisms, and biological 
function.  Three of the characterized triterpenoid 
biosynthetic enzymes convert a shared substrate to different 
compounds; other enzymes to be studied may similarly provide 
structural diversity, metabolize different substrates, or 
provide means to spatially or temporally control expression 
and thus product formation.  The effects of the mutations on 
plant growth, development, and triterpenoid composition will 
facilitate linking each triterpenoid biosynthetic gene with 
an enzyme of known catalytic activity and a specific 
biological role.  Genes to be studied include apparent 
oxidosqualene cyclases, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthases, 
squalene synthases, squalene epoxidases, and cycloeucalenol 
isomerase.  This work will provide a comprehensive accounting 
of triterpenoid skeletons synthesized by 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i>, establish which compounds are derived from each gene 
product, and determine the spatial and temporal expression 
patterns of the various biosynthetic genes. These experiments 
will not only elucidate the biological importance of 
triterpenoid diversity, facilitating future modifications for 
agricultural benefit, but will provide students with broad 
interdisciplinary training that bridges modern chemistry and 
biology.  The data from these studies will be publicly 
available on the project web site (
<a href="http://www.bioc.rice.edu/%7Ebartel/At_triterpenoids.html">
http://www.bioc.rice.edu/~bartel/At_triterpenoids.html
</a>), and the knockout seeds will be deposited in the 
<a href="http://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/%7Eplantbio/Facilities/abrc/abrchome.htm">
ABRC
</a> at Ohio State University for distribution to the 
community.

<blockquote>
Proteins containing long coiled-coil domains have been found 
in animals and yeast to be involved in attaching signaling 
molecules to the large, solid-state components of the cell, 
such as membrane systems, centromeres, centrosomes, or the 
nuclear scaffold. There is growing evidence that they play an 
important role in the spatial and temporal regulation of 
protein positioning in the cell. In contrast, this group of 
proteins has been barely investigated in plants.
<p> The goal of this 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> 2010 project is to identify all 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> proteins that contain long stretches of coiled-coil 
domains, and to functionally characterize a subgroup that has 
been implicated in plant nuclear envelope targeting. 
Preliminary research has identified over 1000 predicted 
coiled-coil proteins in the 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> genome, almost 70% of which are "unknown proteins". 
Examples of coiled-coil proteins with sorting signals for all 
major compartments of the plant cell have been identified.
</p><p> To begin a functional investigation of this large and 
uncharacterized protein class in 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i>, a twofold approach will be taken:
</p><p> (1) An automated computational platform will be 
established on a multi-processor cluster that will allow: (a) 
to identify all long (50 amino acids or longer) coiled-coil 
proteins in 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> by structural prediction algorithms; (b) to integrate 
the output with a battery of sequence and structure analysis 
programs to establish predicted nuclear, organellar, and 
membrane localization, family relationships, functional 
domains, and other relevant features; and (c) to create a 
publicly available, searchable database of 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> coiled-coil proteins, to which experimental data such as 
subcellular location, protein-protein interactions, and 
mutant phenotypes will be added.
</p><p> (2) A group of 16 coiled-coil proteins of unknown 
function, which bind to 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> WPP-domain proteins, will be functionally investigated. 
The WPP domain is a nuclear envelope-targeting domain unique 
to plants, which is involved in positioning Ran GTPase 
activating protein (RanGAP) at the nuclear rim. A group of 
coiled-coil proteins has been experimentally identified, 
which specifically recognize the WPP domain. The hypothesis 
is that some of the identified proteins are specific 
subcellular anchors for WPP-domain proteins. This will be 
tested by investigating: (a) the in vitro and in vivo binding 
specificity of the full-length proteins; (b) their 
subcellular localization; (c) knockout or RNAi phenotypes; 
and (d) the effect of coiled-coil protein knockouts on the 
subcellular positioning of WPP-domain protein-GFP fusions.
</p><p> The first approach will provide an accessible bounty of 
information about features that can help build informed 
hypotheses about the function of individual proteins. The 
second approach will directly investigate the function of 16 
coiled-coil "unknown proteins" on a molecular, cellular, and 
whole-plant level.
</p><p> A list of the accession numbers of the genes to be 
analyzed during this project can be found at 
<a href="/portals/masc/2010_search.jsp">

graduate and undergraduate students at the interface of

scope, the investigation of spatial organization of signaling 
in plant cells might lead to future approaches in 
developmental engineering of crop plants.

<blockquote>
The molecular and physiological functions of the 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> starch metabolism gene network will be determined.  The 
glucose polymers that make up starch, despite their simple 
chemical structures, display a complex molecular architecture 
that is essential for starch function.  The 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> genome sequence allows identification of all the genes 
involved in starch biosynthesis or mobilization, and 
determination of the function of each gene product 
individually and within the metabolic network.  This aspect 
of metabolism is a distinguishing feature of all plant life, 
by which the metabolic gains of photosynthesis are stored and 
used later when light is not available as the energy source.  
Understanding starch assembly and disassembly as a 
comprehensive chemical system, therefore, is required for a 
complete functional description of how the sequence 
information in the 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> genome is translated into the plant life form. In this 
project, "determination of function" implies that the role of 
each protein in the assembly or disassembly of starch 
polymers will be understood at the level of specific 
molecular interactions.  The project focuses on 28 genes that 
are likely to be involved in starch metabolism after the 
production of the glucosyl unit donor. The gene set includes 
starch synthases, branching enzymes, debranching enzymes, a-
amylases, b-amylases, disproportionating enzymes, and starch 
phosphorylases. In each instance the genome sequence predicts 
multiple isoforms.  The two organizing hypotheses of the 
project are that most isoforms have specific, non-overlapping 
roles in creating or dismantling the molecular architecture 
of starch, and that many components of the network act via 
direct functional interactions rather than in a series of 
independent enzymatic steps.  Results will be shared through 
scientific publication, regular web postings (
<a href="http://www.starchmetnet.org/">
www.starchmetnet.org
</a>), and via scientific conferences.  Resources that will 
be developed and made available to the scientific community 
include mutant lines, isoform-specific antibodies, and 
purified recombinant enzymes. The project will have broader 
impacts in the training of scientists at all levels in areas 
such as mRNA profiling, biochemistry, and bioinformatics.  
The project will strive to involve members of under-
represented groups in this activity at the undergraduate 
level, through established partnerships with universities 
that traditionally serve such students.  Starch provides the 
majority of calories in the human diet, and is also a 
renewable resource for energy production and industrial raw 
materials.  Comprehensive understanding of this energy 
storage system will provide a greater ability to exploit 
renewable plant resources to meet the continually increasing 
demands of our changing society and environment.

<blockquote>
The goal of this project is to develop a method for efficient 
homology-dependent site-specific recombination (SSR) in 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i>.  The approach used is based on the recombination-
inducing properties of transposable elements, coupled with 
alternative methods of delivering recombination substrates to 
plant cells.  In previous research, the PI and co-PI have 
shown that DNA and RNA transposable elements can stimulate 
recombination.  First, excision of maize Ac/Ds DNA 
transposons greatly induces homologous recombination in 
plants, including 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i>.  Second, retrotransposons can generate high levels of 
cDNA that recombine readily with genomic sequences. This 
project will develop two-component (recipient and donor) 
transgene constructs that contain partially-overlapping 
visible and selectable marker gene fragments.  The recipient 
component contains, in addition, a maize Ds element inserted 
between the marker genes. The recipient construct is 
integrated into the 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> genome; upon expression of Ac/Ds transposase, Ds 
excision generates a recombination hotspot in the recipient 
construct. The donor construct sequences are delivered into 
the plant cells via several alternative methods, including  
Agrobacterium T-DNA transformation, particle bombardment, 
ectopic chromosomal position, and retrotransposon-generated 
cDNA. Recombination of recipient and donor sequences can be 
detected in somatic cells by the visible marker, and events 
transmitted to progeny can be genetically selected.  
Heritable recombination events will be characterized by 
molecular and genetic analysis to gain a greater 
understanding of SSR mechanisms in plant cells. Project 
results will be available at the following web site: 
<a href="http://www.public.iastate.edu/%7Evoytas/rec_arab.html">
http://www.public.iastate.edu/~voytas/rec_arab.html
</a>.  All reagents (seeds of transformed lines, plasmid 
vectors) will be made available upon request.
<p> Homology-dependent recombination is a powerful tool for 
genetic modification in many organisms; however, methods for 
routine SSR are not yet available for higher plants.  An 
explicit goal of the 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> 2010 project is the development of methods for directed 
mutations and SSR.  Successful completion of this project 
will provide an important new means for making precise 
changes in plant genomes for both fundamental research and 
practical applications.

<blockquote>
Emerging molecular technologies are enabling the collection 
of massive data sets that contain information about the full 
complement of mRNAs, proteins and metabolites in an organism. 
These data sets detail the fluctuations in levels of mRNAs, 
proteins, and metabolites in different organs, tissues and 
cell types, over time, and as the organism is subjected to 
environmental stresses. The development of 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> as a model plant system, and the ensuing emphasis on 
functional genomics in the 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> 2010 program, is leading to the generation of a 
multitude of such data sets. These data sets can compare 
wild-type and genetically modified 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> to understand how a change in a single gene can affect 
the function of the entire genome.  The overall goal is to 
understand the interactions occurring between all the genes 
in a simple plant system, as the basis for developing a 
logical framework to improve the composition and yield of 
agronomically important plant species. Computational 
technologies are essential to integrate and interpret these 
large data sets. The goal is to develop and implement 
powerful software tools for analysis of genome-wide 
expression data.  The software tools will consist of three 
modules that will integrate the visualization of the mRNA, 
protein, and metabolite data sets with our current 
understanding of the 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> metabolic and regulatory network.  These are: 1) A 
metabolic and regulatory network mapping capability with an 
interactive graph display.  2) A data integration capability, 
wherein global profiling data can be clustered, visualized, 
superimposed on the metabolic and regulatory map. 3) A 
modeling capability in which the metabolic or regulatory flow 
in the network is modeled using fuzzy cognitive maps.  These 
tools will be used by the biological community to generate 
and test hypotheses about the regulation of metabolic 
pathways that contribute to the final composition and yield 
of the plant.  The 24-month deliverable will provide a proof-
of-concept for the software, using test data sets from 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i>. The proposed multidisciplinary research will provide 
invaluable opportunities for the integration of genomics and 
bioinformatics education into undergraduate and graduate 
curricula.  Three-five undergraduate students and two 
graduate students will be involved over the course of two 
years.  In addition, interations  with local high school 
teachers are planned to enable motivated high school students 
to participate in this research.  There is also a plan to 
integrate students from underrepresented groups into the 
research project.  The ability to reach young, computer savvy 
students even in high school will be further enhanced by the 
high power computer graphics used in the project. Development 
of this software will lead directly to its use as a teaching 
tool in secondary education. This coordinated approach to 
displaying multiple views of metabolic networks, cellular 
functions, and datasets will put abstract data in the context 
in which it arises, and facilitate studies of uncertainty and 
variation in metabolic networks.  Although the software will 
be directed specifically towards the biology of 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i>, it can be modified for use in any species.  These 
tools, and the database will be freely available to the 
scientific community for academic purposes 
<a href="http://www.botany.iastate.edu/%7Emash/metnetex/metabolicnetex.html">
http://www.botany.iastate.edu/~mash/metnetex/metabolicnetex.html
</a>.  They will provide a novel framework to formulate 
testable hypotheses regarding the function of specific genes 
and expand our holistic understanding of metabolism.

<blockquote>
The 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> genome project uncovered a large set of genes involved 
in nitrogen uptake, metabolism, and allocation (600+).  
Expression studies on a small subset showed that nitrogen 
status regulates the transcription of many of these genes. 
Proposed signals include nitrate, ammonium, glutamine, and 
C:N balance. At present, there is little or no understanding 
of the regulatory molecules or networks involved in signaling 
N-status and integrating N metabolism in plant growth. We 
propose to use expression arrays to identify circuits of 
genes regulated by N-status (inorganic-N and organic-N), to 
use bioinformatic sequence analysis to identify N-responsive 
cis-elements, and to determine the function of key genes we 
identify by defining the phenotype of mutants lacking each 
gene and by determining the biochemical properties of the 
expressed proteins including describing meaningful 
interactions with other macromolecules and determining where 
and when each is expressed. Our analysis will allow us to 
place the activity of these genes and N-regulatory networks 
in the context of plant growth and development.  A computer 
cluster will store the large amounts of data generated in 
this project and we will provide a publicly accessible Web 
page that will include expression databases, gene 
identification information, and all software developed in the 
proposed project. This community resource will be linked to 
the major plant databases for the widest possible 
distribution of information.   It is expected that our 
results will substantially advance our understanding of 
nitrogen metabolism in the context of plant growth, as well 
as provide new insights into our understanding of complex 
regulatory networks.  Given the central role of nitrogen 
availability and metabolism in crop productivity, these 
results will also have broad agricultural impacts.

Determining the function of a network of genes
<p>Definition of "determining the function"
</p><p>In our project, we will define the function of 
approximately 10 new genes from 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i>that are functionally related because they are part of 
the RPM1 disease resistance pathway. Our definition of 
function will entail: 1. Detailed information on the role of 
these genes in disease resistance. 2. Broader definition of 
extra functions that we may uncover for these genes. For 
example, we already know that reduction of function of at 
least two of them causes meristem defects. At present, this 
may be simple pleiotropy. It also may be relevant, meaning 
that the genes in question have additional functions in plant 
growth.

</p><p>Broader Impact
</p><p>Disease resistance is a significant problem in 
agriculture. We will add to the body of knowledge that will 
eventually lead to more effective control of plant disease. 
This is vital because we currently lose up to 30% of crop 
yield to pathogens and pests.

<blockquote>
Plants respond to pathogen attack through a variety of 
signaling pathways consisting of a large number of regulatory 
as well as effector genes.  During the past several years, 
many defense-related genes have been identified through 
genetic analysis conducted in 
<i>Arabidopsis thaliana
</i>.  Importantly, 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> exhibits all of the major kinds of defense responses 
present in other plants. Although a relatively large number 
of 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> defense-related genes have been identified, progress in 
developing overall explanatory models of plant-pathogen 
interactions is currently limited by two major experimental 
roadblocks. First, most of the phenotypic tests that have 
been used to characterize pathogen-host interactions do not 
have sufficient discriminatory power to assign defense-
related genes to specific signal response pathways.  To 
circumvent this limitation, large-scale transcript profiling 
analyses will be carried out on appropriately selected 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> defense-related mutants, including double and triple 
mutants.  Combining genetic epistasis analysis with genomic 
technologies should lead to the development of a much more 
detailed model of how the various defense-related genes 
function and interact in combating pathogen attack.  The 
second factor limiting the understanding of the plant defense 
response is that it is simply not possible to analyze the 
overwhelming volume of current data using conventional 
methods.  The large volume of microarray data that will be 
generated in the near future compounds this problem.  
Moreover, data from different laboratories are not directly 
comparable because standardized experimental conditions are 
not employed.  To help mitigate the problems associated with 
the analysis of large data sets, a sophisticated web-
accessible plant-microbe interaction database (PMIDB) will be 
created to provide a common repository and standardized 
format for experimental data.  The specific aims of the 
project are to:
<p>1) Use transcript-profiling analysis to identify 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> defense-related genes and construct a custom microarray 
(pathoarray) enriched for defense-related genes (A list the 
genes identified so far can be found at 
<a href="http://genetics.mgh.harvard.edu/ausubelweb/nsf2010/NSF_2010.html">
http://genetics.mgh.harvard.edu/ausubelweb/nsf2010/NSF_2010.html
</a>). These custom pathoarrays will be made available to the 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> community at a nominal cost with the expectation that 
the experimental results generated using these pathoarrays 
will be deposited in PMIDB.
</p><p>2) Use the pathoarrays from Aim 1 and 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> defense-related mutants to define the expression 
signatures resulting from the activation of defense pathways.
</p><p>3) Create a web-accessible plant-microbe interaction 
database (PMIDB). This database, which will be accessible at 
<a href="http://genetics.mgh.harvard.edu/ausubelweb/nsf2010/NSF_2010.html">
http://genetics.mgh.harvard.edu/ausubelweb/nsf2010/NSF_2010.html
</a>, will be developed during the next four years and will 
contain standardized experimental procedures for analyzing 
host defense responses, a list of all the pathogenesis-
related mutants and their phenotypes, a list of defense-
related genes with links to various sequence databases, and 
expression profiles of different plant-pathogen interactions 
and different defense-related mutants. 
</p><p>This 2010 Project provides a unique opportunity for 
applying genomic approaches to genetic analysis of plant 
defense mechanisms.  Understanding the mechanisms of plant 
defense is of interest not only to basic science but also to 
development of agriculture and protection of the environment.

<blockquote>
With the availability of the entire 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> genome sequence, one of the next challenges is to 
uncover the functions of the more than 25,000 genes in this 
reference plant. Given the scope of the NSF 2010 program, to 
identify the function of all 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> genes in the next decade, an efficient and cost 
effective approach is necessary to identify mutations in all 
genes. The goal of this program is to create a sequence-
indexed library of mutations in the 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> genome. The Salk Institute Genome Analysis Laboratory (
<a href="http://signal.salk.edu/">
http://signal.salk.edu
</a>) will use high-throughput genome sequencing methods to 
identify the sites of insertion of Agrobacterium T-DNA in the 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> genome. T-DNA transformed plants from the 
Alonso/Crosby/Ecker collection  will be grown, genomic DNA 
will be prepared, T-DNA flanking plant DNA will be recovered 
and sequenced. Insertion site sequences will be aligned with 
the 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> genome sequence and gene annotation will be added. The 
data will be made available via a web accessible graphical 
interface-T-DNAExpress-(
<a href="http://signal.salk.edu/cgi-bin/tdnaexpress">
http://signal.salk.edu/cgi-bin/tdnaexpress
</a>) that will provide both text and DNA searches of the 
insertion sequence database. All DNA sequences will be 
deposited into GenBank (
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
</a>) and also provided to The 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> Information Resource (TAIR) (
<a href="/">

</a>. Seeds from the T-DNA insertion lines will be deposited 
with the

http://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/~plantbio/Facilities/abrc/abrchome.htm
</a>. The ABRC will propagate and distribute seeds to the 
community. The creation of a searchable database containing 
the insertion site information and the availability of the 
corresponding mutant lines in public stock centers will 
provide researchers with ready access to mutants in their 
genes of interest, allowing the testing of hypotheses about 
gene function at an unprecedented rate.

<blockquote>
This project seeks to characterize the entire range of 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> proteins that are regulated by interaction with 14-3-3 
proteins; to identify components from metabolic and signal 
transduction pathways that utilize 14-3-3 regulators, and to 
address fundamental aspects of 14-3-3 function in plants. 
14-3-3s have emerged as critical regulators of important and 
diverse cellular processes that extend to every tissue and 
organ. Indeed, 14-3-3s appear to be intrinsically necessary 
for regulatory events that are absolutely crucial to normal 
growth and development in many species, and especially in 
plants. Initial searches of the 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> genome predict that 14-3-3s interact with fully 10 to 20 
percent of the 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> gene products. The most recognized of 14-3-3 activities 
involve protein kinases, phosphorylation events and signal 
transduction pathways involved in growth and development, 
with one underlying theme being that 14-3-3s bind to specific 
phosphorylated client proteins in order to influence the 
regulation of the target activity. The goals of the present 
project are to identify in the 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> genome client proteins that possess 14-3-3 docking sites 
and to assay the interaction strength of the potential 
docking site against the family of 14-3-3 proteins in order 
to provide a tested, predictive algorithm for determining of 
the spectrum of 14-3-3 interactions that should be expected 
for each client protein. These data, combined with emerging 
data from 14-3-3 knockouts and 14-3-3 isoform expression 
patterns, should provide key insights into the potential 
regulatory functions of the 14-3-3 signal mediating 
molecules, and a central, fully characterized database for 
predicting 14-3-3 mediated signaling in diverse pathways. By 
highlighting potential regulatory sites across diverse gene 
families and metabolic pathways, this project will provide an 
integrating effect on the many projects identifying specific 
functional aspects of 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> gene families. As genes are functionally characterized, 
the 14-3-3 client database will provide immediate predictions 
of phosphorylation and 14-3-3 dependent regulation that will 
accelerate the understanding of the regulation of many gene 
families and metabolic and signaling pathways.

<blockquote>
Protein phosphorylation is a major mode of regulation of 
metabolism, gene expression, and cellular architecture in 
eukaryotic cells, and defining phosphorylation-based 
regulatory networks is essential for understanding the 
function of the 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> genome. The goal of this project is to define 
phosphorylation networks that are related to the function of 
calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) and four closely 
related families; CDPK-related kinases (CRKs), 
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase kinases (PPCKs), PPCK-related 
kinases (PEPRKs), and SNF-1 related kinases (SnRKs). These 88 
kinases, which represent about 9% of all the protein kinases 
in the 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> genome, are involved in all aspects of plant development 
and physiology and participate in the coupling of cellular 
responses to environmental and developmental signals. A list 
of these protein kinases including gene identification 
numbers is available at
<a href="/">
http://www.arabidopsis.org
</a>, and further information including links to database 
records is available at 
<a href="http://plantsp.sdsc.edu/">
http://plantsp.sdsc.edu
</a>. This research will investigate the function of 64 
members of these families through determination of the 
subcellular location of each kinase and identification of 
downstream targets and other proteins with which the kinases 
associate. This information will give insight into the 
physiological roles of each kinase by identifying signaling 
networks in which each participates. This research will also 
determine the target sequences in substrate proteins that are 
phosphorylated by each kinase, and these results will 
contribute to understanding the overlap in kinase function 
and cross-talk between signaling pathways. The results of 
this work will be made available on a yearly basis at the two 
URLs given above.

<blockquote>
Two-component systems are the primary means by which bacteria 
sense and respond to environmental stimuli. These systems are 
comprised of a number of distinct elements, namely histidine 
kinases, response regulators and in the case of 
phosphorelays, histidine phosphotransfer proteins (HPts). 
Genes encoding similar proteins to each of these elements 
have been identified in 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i>, and for the majority of the 35 such genes no function 
has yet been definitively ascribed. An integrated approach to 
elucidate the function of these proteins in 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> is proposed. A combination of gene knockouts and 
inducible overexpression will be used to assess the roles of 
these genes in plant growth and development. The mutant plant 
lines will be characterized in terms of their response to 
biotic and abiotic factors such as hormones, light, and 
osmotic stress, and for their pattern of gene expression. 
Where in the plants these genes are expressed will be 
determined using a combination of GUS fusions and in situ RNA 
analysis. The location of the cognate proteins within the 
cell will also be delineated. To facilitate this 
localization, a series of 10 monoclonal antibodies will be 
generated to marker proteins, each of which resides on a 
distinct membrane. Protein complexes from 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> will be purified and analyzed to determine the 
interactions among these elements and to identify novel 
interacting proteins. Together, these studies will illuminate 
the signaling pathways in which each of these 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> two-component signaling elements function and how they 
interact to control plant growth and development. The data 
from these studies will be deposited on a publicly accessible 
web page that is currently under construction at UNC (
<a href="http://www.bio.unc.edu/research/two-component/">)
http://www.bio.unc.edu/research/two-component/
</a>. A link to this web site will be established on the 
<a href="/">
TAIR
</a> database, and we will coordinate with TAIR to deposit 
data as appropriate. The knockout seeds will be made publicly 
available through deposition in the 
<a href="http://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/%7Eplantbio/Facilities/abrc/abrchome.htm">
ABRC Stock Center
</a> at Ohio 
State. The monoclonals raised against the membrane marker 
proteins will be available for the cost of shipping through 
UNH and the cell lines will also be deposited with the 
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). In keeping with the 
goals of the 2010 project, functional analysis of the two-
component signaling elements will aid in our understanding of 
plants at the organismal, cellular, and evolutionary levels. 
The research will provide functional information on the role 
of 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> two-component signaling systems in plant growth and 
development.  The research will serve to define the 
subcellular location of the two-component signal transduction 
pathways, the interactions between the two-component 
signaling elements, and the downstream targets of the 
pathways. The research should clarify how a signal 
transduction mechanism that arose in bacteria has been 
adapted to plant signal transduction. These studies should 
uncover the functions of several gene families in 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i>.  The proteins encoded by these gene families are 
predicted to interact and thus our studies should aid in the 
development of a paradigm for signaling specificity among 
interacting members of large gene families.  In addition, 
tools will be developed that will be generally applicable in 
defining the subcellular location of proteins in 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i>.

<blockquote>
Apocarotenoids are a diverse set of plant secondary 
metabolites derived from carotenoid breakdown. They have 
significant roles as developmental and environmental response 
signals. They also have important roles as contributors to 
flavor and nutritional quality. A critical advance in 
elucidating apocarotenoid synthesis occurred when the first 
gene encoding a carotenoid dioxygenase, maize Vp14, was 
cloned. Vp14 encodes the limiting enzyme in abscisic acid 
synthesis, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED). 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> contains nine members of a gene family encoding enzymes 
related to NCED, referred to hereafter as RCDs (Related to 
Carotenoid Dioxgenase). Only a subset of the family is 
directly involved in abscisic acid synthesis and the other 
members of the family likely encode enzymes that metabolize a 
range of carotenoids to multiple volatile and non-volatile 
apocarotenoids. One of the family members, RCD1, does indeed 
cleave multiple carotenoid substrates at a different position 
than NCED, supporting this hypothesis. Thus, the RCD family 
exhibits variation both in carotenoid substrates and position 
of cleavage. We will establish the functions of the complete 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> RCD gene family. We have identified knock-out mutants in 
every RCD gene and will construct double and triple knockout 
combinations, as appropriate. Using bacterial expression and 
in vitro assays, the substrate specificities and products of 
each member of the RCD enzyme family will be determined. The 
apocarotenoid metabolic profiles of each mutant, as well as 
appropriate double and triple mutants, will be quantified. 
Mutants will also be examined for phenotypic alterations 
associated with altered apocarotenoid profiles.

<blockquote>
The goal of this 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> 2010 Project is to establish the physiological function 
of 248 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> enzymes and proteins presumed to be involved in various 
networks of phenylpropanoid-acetate metabolism.  There are 
two main objectives: identifying networks associated with 
phenylpropanoid coupling/polymerization (e.g. leading to 
lignins, lignans, suberins, sporopollenins, etc.), including 
how these enzymes/proteins function.  The second objective is 
to precisely identify the different networks that exist in 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> that are involved in the conversion of phenylalanine 
through to the monolignols.  In both objectives, functions 
will be demonstrated in vitro, and we will also establish 
that this is the true physiological function by demonstrating 
temporal and spatial correlation with the segments of the 
metabolic pathway networks involved. This work will thus 
define the organization of the various phenylpropanoid 
radical-radical coupling and related metabolic processes in 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> through its entire life cycle.  The benefits to the 
scientific community will include rapid dissemination of 
results (prior to publication) through a website linked to 
the 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> sites, and the provision of research materials (genes, 
constructs, recombinant proteins, transgenic and mutant 
plants) as needed.  Another important benefit will be the new 
knowledge gained on these hitherto difficult systems (e.g. 
coupling/polymerization) involving macromolecular assemblies, 
and the new insights that will be gained.  For enzymes/genes 
chosen that are ultimately not involved in these pathways, it 
is considered that metabolite profiling will provide a clue 
as to function, and this will then be examined also. Further, 
in addition to lignification, this study will shed important 
light on other highly regulated radical-radical phenolic 
coupling systems in vivo including: the construction of seed 
coats and metabolites therein; in generating the 
(strengthened) matrix of trichomes; in forming suberized 
tissue and in strengthening flower stalks; in biosynthesizing 
sporopollenin (a remarkably stable component of pollen 
grains); in reinforcing cutinized tissue; in cross-linking 
cell wall carbohydrates through hydroxycinnamic acid 
(phenolic) coupling, in producing a plethora of defense 
compounds and presumably for other purposes awaiting 
discovery. In addition to peerreviewed journals, our research 
findings, information and materials generated by this 
research will be made available to public databases, updated 
periodically on a (monthly) basis, by posting 
data/information on a dedicated website (
<a href="http://ibc.wsu.edu/lewislab/nsf/index.html">
http://ibc.wsu.edu/lewislab/nsf/index.html
</a>) that will be linked up to the 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> network sites relevant to the project.  This information 
will include: recombinant protein expression vectors 
constructed by our laboratory; gene identification and gene 
function analysis; kinetic data results; gene expression 
profiles; metabolite and lignin analysis; in situ 
hybridization data; and light microscopy documentation.

<blockquote>
Because of their sessile nature, plants have evolved a wide 
range of strategies to respond to changes in their 
environment.  For a number of these responses plants have co-
opted (or co-evolved) systems that are shared with other 
taxa. However, many of the environmental (both biotic and 
abiotic) response systems plants utilize are apparently 
specific to plants and are often comprised of novel molecular 
components.  With the recent completion of the 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> genome sequencing project we are now in a unique 
position to ask fundamental questions about the functions of 
these latter set of regulatory proteins in plants.  Of the 
~11,000 protein families formed by the 25,498 predicted genes 
of 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i>, only ~150 families appear to be plant-specific.  One of 
these plant-specific families is the NPH3/RPT2 family.  This 
family, which is comprised of 32 novel proteins (for more 
information about these proteins/genes, including GenBank 
accession numbers, see 
<a href="http://www.biosci.missouri.edu/liscum/nph3-rpt2figs.html">
http://www.biosci.missouri.edu/liscum/nph3-rpt2figs.html
</a>), was first identified with the cloning of NPH3 
(NONPHOTOTROPIC HYPOCOTYL 3) and RPT2 (ROOT PHOTOTROPISM 2) - 
genes identified in screens for mutants with altered 
phototropic responses.  NPH3 and RPT2 function in early 
phototropic signaling and appear to act as modular scaffold 
proteins to recruit or activate enzymatic components of the 
transduction chains, including the respective photoreceptors 
themselves, mediating phototropic responses. Given the high 
degree of similarity in primary sequence and secondary 
structure between all members of the NPH3/RPT2 family it 
seems appropriate to hypothesize that these plant-specific 
proteins may act as scaffolds for sensor-containing signaling 
complexes utilized in a variety of abiotic and/or biotic 
responses.  The major goals proposed for this project are to 
determine mRNA and protein expression patterns, and 
biological functions for each member of the NPH3/RPT2 family. 
The expression studies are proposed as a means of developing 
logical and focused analyses of loss- and gain-of-function 
mutants.  In such a way we expect to be able to determine 
what biological processes require the function of each member 
of the NPH3/RPT2 family.  All project data will be publicly 
available through a project database (
<a href="http://www.biosci.missouri.edu/liscum/NPH3-RPT2family.html">
http://www.biosci.missouri.edu/liscum/NPH3-RPT2family.html
</a>), as well as The 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> Information Resource (TAIR) (
<a href="/">
http://www.arabidopsis.org
</a>). Given the plant-specific and novel nature of the 
NPH3/RPT2 family, it is likely that elucidation of biological 
functions for the family will represent an important step in 
understanding fundamental aspects of plant growth and 
development.

<blockquote>
The goal of this project is to develop a resource for the 
scientific community that promotes expanded use of natural 
genetic variation in reaching the 2010 Project objective of 
assigning a function to each 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> gene. At least four new sets of mapped Recombinant 
Inbred Lines (RILs) will be produced. Potential pairs of 
parents from hundreds of available wild type accessions will 
be systematically screened for genetic and phenotypic 
variance and pairwise distances. The chosen parents will 
include wild lines not previously exploited. Simple Sequence 
Length DNA Polymorphisms (SSLPs) will be used as much as 
possible for mapping. Ninety-five individuals, from sets of 
400 RI lines will be mapped at one hundred loci, generating a 
map with a density of approximately 6 centiMorgans.  Seeds 
for all RILs will be publicly available through the 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> Biological Resource Center (
<a href="http://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/%7Eplantbio/Facilities/abrc/abrchome.htm">

</a>) and maps and mapping data will be available online 
through The 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> Information Resource (
<a href="/">
http://www.arabidopsis.org
</a>) by January 2004. During the course of this 
project, undergraduate and graduate students and technicians 
will be trained in robotics, molecular biology, genetics, and 
quantitative trait mapping.  In addition, students in the 
Biotechnology Program at the Austin Community College will 
receive similar training through an outreach program. 
Conventional genetics used in a small number of laboratory 
strains of 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i>, will not be able to reach the 2010 Project goal of 
complete knowledge of every plant gene's function. This 
project will provide a way to map and identify genes in local 
wild populations of 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> that are important for adaptation to many different 
environments and are the result of many different 
evolutionary histories.  These different environments will 
include different soil types, day lengths, pest populations, 
moisture levels, temperatures, and other factors.  This will 
eventually lead to a better understanding of important 
adaptations to incorporate into the world's crops.

<blockquote>
This project will establish a foundation for identifying every 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> gene with an essential function during seed development.  
This information is central to the 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> 2010 Project and to identifying the minimal gene set 
required for growth and development of a model plant.  The 
project will focus on genes that give a visible seed 
phenotype when disrupted by mutation.  The network of genes 
chosen for analysis is therefore not defined by shared 
biochemical or molecular features but rather by the fact that 
they are essential.  
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> contains an estimated 500 such EMB genes required for 
normal seed development and another 200 genes required for 
normal seed pigmentation.  The approach outlined here is to 
coordinate the collection, analysis, and presentation of 
information on more than half of these genes based on cloning 
of mutant alleles. Information on essential genes and the 
corresponding mutants will be obtained from a variety of 
public and private sources and synthesized for efficient use 
by the community.  The resulting insights into biological 
functions of these diverse genes will complement research in 
other labs on the biochemical activities of specific gene 
products.  The result will be an integrated view of essential 
gene functions within a cellular, organismal, and 
evolutionary context.
<p>Project objectives are to: (1) use a combination of 
forward and reverse genetics to approach saturation for 
cloned EMB genes;  (2) standardize phenotypic 
characterization of the corresponding mutants; (3) collect 
related information on seed pigment mutants;  (4) make seeds 
for all mutant lines available through 
<a href="http://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/%7Eplantbio/Facilities/abrc/abrchome.htm">
ABRC
</a>;  (5) understand 
the functions of these genes in growth and development;  (6) 
determine through expression studies and comparative sequence 
analysis why these genes are essential;  (7) integrate this 
information into a simple but robust database with a format 
compatible with 
<a href="/">
TAIR
</a>; (8) establish a model for public release of private 
sector resources; and (9) develop outreach and training 
programs that complement research efforts in 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> functional genomics.  Project deliverables include 
public access to synthesized information and seed stocks for 
500 mutants defective in 300 different EMB genes; similar 
information for another 100 pigment mutants defective in 75 
genes; valuable expression data for genes active in young 
seeds (wild type and selected mutants); and a database that 
should serve as a model for analyzing and presenting 
information on large collections of mutants.  The project web 
page (
<a href="http://www.seedgenes.org/">
www.seedgenes.org
</a>) will be linked through TAIR (
<a href="/">
www.arabidopsis.org
</a>).  Release of the first version of the database is 
scheduled for March 2002.  Profiles of the first 100 
essential genes examined in detail will be presented at that 
time.
</p><p>This project builds upon an existing collaboration between 
Oklahoma State University and Syngenta that has over the past 
4 years resulted in identification of 350 tagged emb mutants 
and preliminary sequence data for about 200 of these mutants.  
This represents a significant corporate investment into a 
project that would be difficult and expensive to duplicate 
with federal funding.  The current proposal includes 
substantial public release of private materials with minimal 
restrictions and provides a mechanism for collecting and 
analyzing community-wide information on essential genes.  
Such efforts are needed at the start of the 2010 Project to 
focus attention on genes with important biological functions.

<blockquote>
Existing genefinders use information about splice sites and 
differences between exons and introns, but do not explicitly 
incorporate information about sequences known as splicing 
enhancers, which promote incorporation of exons into mRNA. 
This is a project to characterize exonic splicing enhancers 
in 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i>. Although splicing enhancers likely function in splice 
site selection in many plant genes, and contribute to the 
regulation of alternative splicing, plant splicing enhancers 
have not yet been described in detail. Computational analysis 
of a database of 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> exons and introns will be used to identify candidate 
splicing enhancer sequences. The role of these sequences, and 
sequences from genes that are known to be alternatively 
spliced, will be tested in transgenic 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> using a splicing reporter construct. The activity of 
these enhancers will be examined in transgenes that depend on 
exon inclusion for expression. This will include analysis of 
the tissue-specificity of splicing enhancer activity and 
should provide an extensive database of information about the 
role of particular sequences in promoting splicing. This 
project will generate:
<p>1) 2,000 publicly available transgenic lines, available 
through the 
<a href="http://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/%7Eplantbio/Facilities/abrc/abrchome.htm">
ABRC
</a>, carrying splicing reporter genes with 
defined candidate splicing enhancer sequences
</p><p>2) A description of marker gene expression for each 
splicing enhancer candidate. This will consist of a 
description of all expression patterns and images of typical 
and selected patterns, available through the internet (
<a href="http://www.tigr.org/2010-splicing/">
http://www.tigr.org/2010-splicing/

improvements to the existing GlimmerM server (
<a href="http://www.tigr.org/softlab/glimmerm/">
http://www.tigr.org/softlab/glimmerm/
</a>).
</p><p>Effective use of the complete nucleotide sequence of 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> requires improved gene annotation. Information about the 
messenger RNA products of genes is incomplete. This project 
will provide to the scientific community both experimental 
data on splicing enhancers that will improve gene annotation, 
and genetic material for further study.

The technique of laser-capture microdissection (LCM) will be 
developed and optimized for plant tissues. This is a method 
originally developed for animal tissues, whereby individual 
cells are harvested by tacking them to a plastic film with a 
low-power infrared laser that can be aimed at single cells 
while viewing the tissue slice under a microscope. Using this 
method, it should be possible to recover specific cell types 
or developmental stages from complex tissues consisting of 
many cell types. Cells recovered in this manner can be 
analyzed with regard to gene expression profiles, protein 
profiles, and other properties. Based on preliminary data, it 
will be necessary to test a variety of tissue fixation and 
sectioning methods to adapt the method to plants. This 
project will optimize the LCM technique, using a variety of 
plant tissue sources and purity markers for specific cells. 
Detailed protocols will be provided to the biological 
community at the website

<blockquote>
The entire 130 million base pair genome of the plant 
<i>Arabidopsis thaliana
</i> was finished last year.  The objective of this project 
is to leverage the genome sequence to catalog the naturally 
occurring genetic variation in the species.  The project is 
based on the theoretical insight that, in highly self-
fertilizing organisms, like 
<i>A. thaliana
</i>, it should be possible to create such a catalog very 
efficiently by looking at the pattern of variation in a 
number of small segments distributed over the genome.  Rather 
than sequencing the entire genome of one additional 
individual, one should sequence 1% of the genome in 100 
individuals.
<p>Specifically, the project will sequence 1500-2000 
chromosomal segments of length 500-700 base pairs, 
distributed over the genome, in a sample of 96 carefully 
selected individuals. The data will be publicly available 
through GenBank, as well as through a highly flexible 
relational database developed specifically for this purpose. 
The database will be equipped with web-based bioinformatics 
tools to query it, and will be continuously updated.
</p><p>The project represents the first serious attempt to 
describe the genomic variation in a species.  It is highly 
relevant to the objectives of the 2010 project in a general 
sense, because it will not be possible to "determine the 
function of all genes [...] within their cellular, 
organismal, and evolutionary contexts" without understanding 
how genetic variation is structured in the species.  More 
immediately, the database will be an invaluable resource for 
plant geneticists interested in finding the genes responsible 
for variation in agriculturally important traits such as 
drought tolerance.  In this respect, the project should be 
compared to the large databases of human variation that are 
currently being created to aid genetic epidemiology. The 
tools and methods created for this project will also be 
directly applicable to several organisms of direct economic 
importance, such as rice and barley.   Finally, the database 
will serve as a very important training tool for students in 
computational and evolutionary biology, and in statistical 
genetics.

<i>Arabidopsis thaliana

research tool for plant Biologists. A primary motivation for 
the sequencing of 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> was that it would serve as a reference for other plant 
genomes. For this to be realized the functions of a large 
number of unknown and hypothetical genes must be deduced and 
a cross-reference between genes in

development of the data resources will lead to a better 
understanding of gene expressions and function in plants.
<p>Predicted genes will be amplified and used to construct a 
whole genome microarray that will be used to look at patterns 
of gene express through the plant life cycle. Expressions 
data can help provide both functional assignments for genes 
and used in identifying metabolic pathways. The data will be 
analyzed using a suite of clustering and pattern recognition 
tool. A number of databases will be combined and integrated 
to provide a web-based view of gene expression and 
identification in

<blockquote>
This project is aimed at functionally defining the expression 
patterns and substrate reactivities of the 
<i>Arabidopsis thaliana
</i> cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (P450) gene family that 
represents approximately 0.6% of this plant's genome.  The 
proteins encoded by these genes mediate oxidative 
transformations in a wide array of biosynthetic and 
detoxicative pathways essential for plant growth.  Because of 
their roles in this wide diversity of metabolic processes and 
their relative lack of post-translational modification, they 
serve as downstream reporters for the direct activation of 
many different biochemical pathways responding to chemical, 
developmental and environmental cues.  Extensive divergence 
of catalytic site as well as noncatalytic site residues has 
resulted in a high degree of primary structure variation in 
this very diverse P450 gene superfamily that presents 
unsurpassed complexity in assigning function to individual 
genomic DNA sequences.  We will further the functional 
definition of 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> P450s by creating microarrays for analysis of the mRNA 
expression patterns in tissues at different developmental 
stages.  Imaging of the responses of individual P450 genes 
with respect to a variety of internal and external chemical 
cues as well as changing environmental conditions (UV damage, 
pathogen attack, insect attack, cold stress, etc.) and 
collations of these response patterns with respect to plant 
biochemical pathways will provide the basis for assigning 
prospective functions to these enzymes.  Overexpression of a 
subset of these P450s in yeast and baculovirus protein 
production systems and incorporation into membrane-
scaffolding protein complexes suitable for high-throughput 
screening of substrate reactivities will provide the basis 
for assigning definitive function(s) to these enzymes.  These 
results serve to elucidate this model plant's biochemical 
responses to a variety of stress conditions and provide 
genomic technology tools needed for assessment of the diverse 
P450 gene family as well as other membrane protein families.  
Data on the organization of the 273 P450 genes, alignments of 
available ESTs, patterns of mRNA expression defined by 
microarray analysis and P450 substrate preferences defined by 
functional protein expression will be made available at 
<a href="http://arabidopsis-p450.biotec.uiuc.edu/">

<blockquote>
The goal of this project is to determine the biological 
function of genes which encode six families of structurally 
related proteins, called the cellulose synthase like (CSL) 
proteins.  Based on the sequence similarity to cellulose 
synthase, it is hypothesized that the CSL  genes encode 
processive glycosyltransferases that may catalyze the 
synthesis of some of the non-cellulosic polymers that 
comprise plant cell walls and other exopolysaccharides such 
as stylar secretions and mucilage, or the glycosyl residues 
on arabinogalactan proteins  Because plant cell walls and 
exopolysaccharides are the dominant component of biomass on 
earth, knowledge of the enzymes and genes associated with the 
synthesis of these compounds may facilitate methods for the 
production and utilization of plant biomass.
<p>The technical approach that will be used to determine the 
function of the CSL genes exploits the recently completed 
full genome sequence of 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> to facilitate directed genetic analysis of the genes.  
Most of the CSL  genes will be inactivated by insertional 
mutagenesis.  In addition, the expression of the CSL  genes 
will be altered by producing transgenic plants that have 
increased or decreased accumulation of mRNA for the CSL  
genes.  The effects of the mutations and transgenic events on 
the growth and development of the plants, and on plant 
polysaccharide composition will be analyzed in order to 
associate each CSL  gene with a specific  biological role and 
enzyme of known catalytic activity.  A list of the accession 
numbers of the genes to be analyzed during this project can 
be found at

<blockquote>
Quantitative differences in the expression of genes involved 
in disease resistance responses will be investigated using a 
functional genomics approach that involves a novel 
application of quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis to 
microarray data. Regulatory QTLs controlling natural 
variation in induced gene expression patterns (i.e., 
expression level polymorphisms, ELPs) through QTL analysis of 
microarray data for ELPs from genetically segregating 
populations will be identified. Dissection of regulatory 
networks using genetic analysis of natural allelic variation 
will provide an efficient method for searching for regulatory 
loci at the systems biology level and avoids unnatural 
traumatic perturbations to gene regulation that are caused by 
extreme mutations. QTL dissection of natural variation is 
complementary to mutant analysis as it is likely to reveal 
different aspects of the regulatory network controlling 
disease resistance than mutant analysis because qualitatively 
inherited resistance genes do not account for all the aspects 
of complex pathways.  This project aims to: 1) develop 
integrated molecular and statistical approaches for the 
dissection of quantitatively inherited traits, 2) determine 
if expression level polymorphisms involved in the variation 
of disease resistance pathways in 
<i>Arabidopsis thaliana
</i> are due to regulatory QTLs, structural QTLs, or both, 
and 3) characterize individual genes at the molecular level 
that encode the regulatory QTLs. This will be accomplished by 
surveying accessions for natural variation in ELPs in 
response to induction of defense related pathways by a 
salicylic acid analog (dichloroisonicotinic acid) and 
jasmonic acid using Affymetrix chips for the preliminary 
global screen and spotted microarrays to confirm reproducible 
ELPs. Recombinant inbred lines derived from crosses between 
polymorphic accessions will then be phenotyped for ELPs using 
targeted DNA microarrays designed with novel applications of 
statistical methods. QTLs associated with ELPs will be mapped 
by employing an innovative application of established QTL 
mapping methodologies, including composite interval mapping 
and permutation thresholds. This approach will allow the 
identification of regulatory QTLs, a subset of which will be 
cloned using a combination of candidate gene and extreme 
allele approaches. Ultimately, these approaches will enable 
massively parallel QTL analysis for mRNA, protein and 
metabolite levels relative to the whole plant phenotypes.  
The data generated from this project will be available at (

<blockquote>
The 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> 2010 Project is focused on determining the function of 
each of the 26,000 genes found in the genome of the model 
plant 
<i>Arabidopsis thaliana
</i>. One of the most definitive methods for determining gene 
function is to create an organism in which that gene is 
missing and then ask the question: how does that simple 
genetic defect change how the organism develops and 
functions? Such mutant organisms are commonly called 
'knockouts' and this project is focused on developing and 
using new technologies  to provide knockout plants  to the 
research community.   Funds from this project will continue 
to support the University of Wisconsin Knockout Plant 
Facility, established under a previous award, as well as 
support research on using new high throughput methods for 
more easily identifying large numbers of knockout plants. The 
research community and public can obtain information on the 
procedures used to screen for mutants and to obtain seeds 
from this project via the website already established and 
maintained at the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology 
Center Knockout  Plant Facility (
<a href="http://www.biotech.wisc.edu/Arabidopsis/">
http://www.biotech.wisc.edu/Arabidopsis/
</a>). One new technology supported under this project is the 
use of a recently developed method for creating 'DNA chips' 
(i.e., small pieces of glass on which a very large number of 
different DNA sequences are synthesized and displayed) to 
develop new methods of finding and cataloging knockout 
organisms.  Results from this research will be published in 
the appropriate scientific  journals and the methodology for 
high-throughput screens to find new knockout plants will be 
described on the above website.  More broadly, results from 
this project may provide new methods for determining the 
function of genes in any sequenced genome, information which 
is critical for further advances in agriculture and medicine.

<blockquote>
Peroxisomes are ubiquitous subcellular organelles that 
possess a diverse array of enzymes and other protein contents 
that vary with developmental stage, and in response to 
environmental cues. The overall goal of this project is to 
identify 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> genes coding for peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) 
involved in the biogenesis and functioning of peroxisomes, 
and then determine the specific function of the gene 
products. "Peroxin" genes code for a set of proteins 
(peroxins) that participate specifically in peroxisomal 
biogenesis (organelle replication and differentiation). Most 
peroxins are PMPs. To date, 15 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> orthologs of 23 eukaryotic peroxin genes have been 
identified, but a function has been determined for only 4 of 
these 15 orthologs. Public access to this information will be 
available at (
<a href="http://lsweb.la.asu.edu/rtrelease">
http://lsweb.la.asu.edu/rtrelease
</a>). The function(s) of these PMPs will be determined 
experimentally through a multi-pronged approach, i.e., 
elucidation of their subcellular  localization, intracellular 
sorting pathways, and molecular sorting signals in suspension 
cells from wild type and mutant plants, and developmentally 
through interactions of RNAs with increasingly available ESTs 
on microarrays. Also, phenotypic and functional 
complementation results obtained with available T-DNA 
knockouts will be examined. Experimental results will be 
presented by students and postdoctoral persons attending 
local and national meetings, and will be published in 
refereed journal articles. The research is expected to 
elucidate the function of at least 10 genes related to the 
biogenesis and functioning of peroxisomes in 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i>; this is consistent with the Objectives of the 2010 
Project. Since peroxisomal mutations are lethal in humans, 
and peroxisomes are essential for seedling establishment and 
photo-autotrophic growth of oilseed and other crop plants, 
the knowledge obtained for functions of 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> peroxisomal genes can and very likely will be applied to 
biotechnological improvements of agriculturally-important 
crop plants, and to possibly speed therapeutic resolution of 
peroxisomal biogenetic diseases in human infants.

<blockquote>
The ubiquitin (Ub)/26S proteasome proteolytic pathway plays 
an integral role in the growth, development, homeostasis, and 
defense of plants by selectively removing abnormal 
polypeptides and short-lived regulatory proteins.  In this 
pathway, proteins are first covalently tagged with Ubs; these 
substrates are then degraded by the 26S proteasome with the 
concomitant release of the Ubs for reuse.  The Ub-protein 
ligases (or E3s) determine the specificity of Ub conjugation 
and hence control the selectivity of the system. Their 
importance in plants is best demonstrated by the fact that 
the 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> genome encodes over 900 different E3s.  Preliminary 
genetic analyses of just a few have identified important 
roles for E3s in hormone and stress responses, light 
signaling, circadian rhythms, enzymatic regulation, and 
pattern formation.
<p>To help define the depth and breath of ubiquitination in 
plants, this project will analyze the 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> E3 families in detail.  Bioinformatic approaches will be 
used to assemble the E3s into subfamilies.  For 
representative examples, protein interaction techniques will 
assign each with appropriate accessory factors and 
biochemical assays will confirm that each has Ub-ligase 
activity.  Their expression patterns and locations will be 
examined by DNA microarrays and by analysis of GFP-E3 
fusions.  Yeast two-hybrid and mass spectrometric techniques 
will identify possible substrates.  Functions will be further 
explored by the phenotypic analysis of appropriate 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> mutants. All information will be released to the 
scientific community in a freely accessible public web site (
<a href="http://www.hort.wisc.edu/vierstra/vierstra1.htm">
http://www.hort.wisc.edu/vierstra/vierstra1.htm
</a>).  The results generated will form an essential 
framework for understanding E3 diversity, help reveal 
specific functions for each E3 type, and will develop a 
database of proteins whose abundance is affected by Ub-
mediated proteolysis. Collectively, the project will provide 
comprehensive information on a large and important cluster of 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> genes/proteins that ultimately can be used to devise new 
strategies to alter proteolysis when it interferes with crop

<blockquote>
The goal of this project is to develop a novel optical 
technique, termed Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer 
(BRET), as a resource for the plant functional genomics 
community, specifically in the model species 
<i>Arabidopsis thaliana
</i>. BRET has shown promise as a tool to chart the physical 
contacts between specific cellular proteins, and their time-
resolved interactions, in living tissue and in real time. 
While the importance of such interactions has long been 
recognized in the life sciences, the corresponding 
experimental tools have largely been limited to in vitro 
conditions or to heterologous, non-plant organisms. 
Therefore, the BRET technique will provide a unique 
contribution toward delineating the functions of the 25,000 
genes thought to be contained  within the 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> genome.
<p>BRET is a form of radiation-free energy transfer that can 
occur when two compatible optical probes are brought into 
molecular proximity. In detail, to probe for a protein-
protein interaction between two given partner proteins, the 
two proteins are genetically fused to a blue light emitting 
luciferase and to a blue light absorbing yellow fluorescent 
protein. If the two hybrid proteins interact, the excitation 
energy of the luciferase may be transferred to the 
fluorescent protein, resulting in an easily detected yellow-
shift in the luminescence spectrum.
</p><p>The first goal of this project is to construct molecular 
genetic tools, such as cloning vectors, for the expression of 
BRET hybrid proteins. Second, instrumentation and 
experimental protocols will be optimized for time-resolved 
BRET data  acquisition. Moreover, as a prototype example of 
the efficacy of BRET for  research in plants, BRET will be 
applied to illuminate the genetic networks  that mediate the 
control of nuclear gene expression by light and the circadian 
clock. Resources developed in this project shall be widely 
disseminated to encourage their application within the entire 
plant science community  (

<blockquote>
This project concerns a family of metal transporters called 
YELLOW STRIPE-LIKE (YSL), which have been identified based on 
their very strong sequence similarity to the YS1 protein of 
maize.  The function of YS1 is in the primary uptake of iron 
from the soil.  However, unlike other known plant iron 
transporters, YS1 transports iron that is complexed by 
specific plant-derived Fe(III) chelators called 
phytosiderophores.  There are eight YSL proteins encoded in 
the 
<i>Arabidopsis thaliana
</i> genome (
<a href="http://www.bio.umass.edu/biology/ewalker">
http://www.bio.umass.edu/biology/ewalker
</a>), but they cannot function in phytosiderophore uptake, 
since 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> (like all non-grasses) can neither synthesize nor use 
phytosiderophores.  
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> does make and use a related compound, nicotianamine, 
which is the biosynthetic precursor to phytosiderophores. 
Preliminary evidence suggests that YSL proteins mediate 
transport of metals bound to nicotianamine.  The many roles 
of nicotianamine in achieving proper metal ion allocation in 
plants are incompletely understood, but there is strong 
evidence that nicotianamine is necessary for distribution of 
Fe, Zn, and Mn via phloem, and that it is required for 
transport of Cu in xylem.
<p>The functions of the eight  
<i>Arabidopsis thaliana
</i> YSL genes will be determined from the narrowest 
definition of function-biochemical function, to the broadest 
definition of function-the role of these proteins in the 
growth and development of the plant. A comprehensive 
description of the function of each YSL protein will be 
formed that will answer these questions: Which metals are 
transported by YSL proteins? Which cells express each YSL and 
therefore are involved in transporting these metals? Which 
nutrient conditions affect expression of each YSL family 
member?  In what way(s) does abolishing specific YSL genes 
affect the pattern of metal ion distribution in the plant?  
By integrating this specific information for all eight YSL 
genes, our understanding of the metal ion allocation 
mechanisms used by plants will be greatly improved.
</p><p>Sequence information will be made immediately available 
through Genbank and on the project website.  The website will 
also be updated with experimental data for each YSL gene as 
it becomes available.

<blockquote>
The initial annotation of the complete sequence of 
<i>Arabidopsis thaliana
</i> indicates that of the 11,601 distinct gene types found, 
only 35% are represented in the genome by one gene, while 37% 
are represented by gene families with five or more different 
members. For a majority of the larger gene families, the 
molecular function of the encoded proteins is known.  
However, the role of individual gene family members in 
specific physiological or development pathways is often 
uncertain.  The focus of this project is to develop protocols 
to assist in describing the in planta function of individual 
gene family members in the AHA,  
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> plasma membrane H+-ATPase, gene family. The AHA genes 
code for proteins that couple ATP hydrolysis to proton 
transport across the plasma membrane of plant cells. The 
proton-motive force produced by the ATPases then drives the 
transport of solutes via carriers and channels. In 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i>, the proton pumps comprise a gene family with at least 
twelve gene isoforms. Expressed in different tissues, the 
pumps provide the underlying energy for a variety of 
fundamental plant processes such as cellular homeostasis, 
mineral and metabolite transport, cell growth and plant 
morphogenesis, and a variety of responses to the environment 
including stomatal control, tropic responses, and defense 
related mechanisms. As a first step towards determining the 
function of the AHA genes, we have screened over 80,000 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> T-DNA insertion lines and have identified twenty-nine 
mutants.  This collection of mutants includes ten of twelve 
AHA gene family members, with multiple alleles for many 
isoforms. Exhaustive screening of the current 80,000 lines 
and screening of recently available lines should make it 
possible to reach the goal of finding multiple alleles for 
each gene family member. To understand the role these genes 
individually and in the gene family, we will take the 
following approaches:  -  We will isolate, outcross and 
prepare aha mutant lines for analysis and distribution to the 
<a href="http://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/%7Eplantbio/Facilities/abrc/abrchome.htm">
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> Biological Resource Center
</a>, Columbus, OH 43210.
<p>- We will perform genetic crosses and create multiple 
insert lines (i.e., double, triple mutants, etc.) in order to 
uncover genetic redundancy in the gene family.
</p><p>- We will test for conditional phenotypes in the mutant 
AHA lines by comparing mutants to wild-type plants under 
conditions designed to reveal differences in development, 
responses to environmental stimuli, nutrient uptake, etc.
</p><p>- We will establish an on-line database of experimental 
conditions designed for a broad range of phenotypic analysis. 
Preliminary protocols will be available Year 1, first 
quarter.  Detailed protocols and associated data will be 
added as it is generated.
</p><p>The availability of twenty-nine AHA gene-family mutant 
alleles provides the raw materials for substantial progress 
into the function of the AHA genes and gene family. The 
availability of this resource at a predominantly 
undergraduate institution provides a means of integrating 
genomic scale research with undergraduate training.
