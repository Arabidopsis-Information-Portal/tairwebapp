<A NAME="informatics_wk"><b> MASC plans two Workshops about the Informatics Needs of Arabidopsis Community</b></a>
<p>
Since the release of the Arabidopsis genome sequence, significant coordinated investments in the functional genomics of Arabidopsis have resulted in a plethora of productive research activities. The last ten years of Arabidopsis research has generated a variety of large-scale datasets. Arabidopsis data is not only increasing in quantity but also in complexity. Consequently, the database needs of the Arabidopsis community are evolving. These changing informatics needs will require solutions as well as plans for their sustainability. A sustainable Arabidopsis database for the future will need to be agile, cost-effective, responsive to the community, and multinational. To crystallize this vision, MASC, in collaboration with North American Arabidopsis Steering Committee, is planning to organize two workshops that will be held in spring 2010. These workshops will provide forums to discuss the informatics needs of the Arabidopsis community and potential solutions to meet those needs. The first workshop will be aimed at understanding the current and future needs with respect to databases and informatics tools. The discussions in the second workshop will focus on potential solutions for meeting the needs of the Arabidopsis community.
<p> Approximately 70 researchers from across the globe have been invited to attend the workshops. The first workshop will be held April 15-16, 2010 in Nottingham, UK. This workshop will bring together Arabidopsis researchers that generate large sets of genomics data and various types of functional genomics data as well as the researchers that mainly use Arabidopsis data on a small scale. These researchers will discuss the current and future informatics needs of the Arabidopsis community. In the second workshop, the brief resulting from the first workshop will be used by informatics experts to suggest potential solutions for the needs. This workshop is planned on May 10-11, 2010 in Washington, DC, USA.  In addition to some of the participants of from the first workshop, the second workshop will include researchers that manage other model organism databases as well as scientists that manage other plant databases or informatics collaboratives. Some informatics experts from industry will also be invited to the second workshop. Potential informatics models to meet the needs of Arabidopsis community and plausible international funding models for future databases and informatics services will be discussed in the workshops. 
  <p>The outcomes of two workshops will be presented at the major plant-focused conferences, including International Conference on Arabidopsis Research, which will be held on June 6-10, 2010 in Yokohama, Japan. This information from the workshops will be useful to the funding agencies in developing strategies for international collaboration to meet the database needs of the Arabidopsis community in the coming years.

<A NAME="NPGI"><a href="http://npgi-workshop.wetpaint.com/?mail=1128"><b>Summary of Recent US National Plant Genome Initiative Community Workshop</b></a>
<p>The purpose of the August, 2008 meeting was to bring a broad group of stakeholders together to discuss the outcomes of the first ten years of the US  
National Plant Genome Initiative (NPGI) as well as the challenges and opportunities ahead for the next five to ten years. The NPGI is managed by the Interagency Working Group on Plant  
Genomes (IWG-PG) which is currently in the process of developing a new five-year plan. <br> <a href="http://npgi-workshop.wetpaint.com/?mail=1128"><u>A wiki page was established</u></a> to provide a summary, meeting notes,
and permit feedback and discussion on the topics. Arabidopsis research was an important part of the discussion. <p>
Some excerpts from the workshop notes:
<li> Biological complexity far exceeds what can be learned from analyzing more DNA sequences. There needs to be a balance between genomics data and studies on fundamental biological processes.
<li> Translation from basic to applied biology is important and requires a new type of training (with funding to implement) for the next generation of scientists. The gap between basic and applied research needs to be bridged. One way this gap is reinforced through separation of graduate majors and possibly through narrowly-focused scientific meetings.
<li> It is critical to have testable models of complex processes to develop phenotype prediction based on genotypes in and across species.
<li> There needs to be more collaboration between genomicists and breeders to link basic and applied science.
<li> It is important to understand dynamic processes at the cellular and subcellular levels.

    <A NAME="redei"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_R%C3%A9dei"><b>Arabidopsis Pioneer Passes</b></a>
    <p> George Rédei, professor emeritus at the University of Missouri and a pioneer of Arabidopsis research, died November 10, 2008 at the age of 87.
    <p>According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_R%C3%A9dei"><u>wikipedia</u></a>, Dr. Rédei was born in Austria, lived in Hungary, and moved to the US in 1957.
    Notably, he brought Arabidopsis seeds with him to Missouri, becoming the first person in the US to conduct Arabidopsis research, a distinction that lasted about 20 years until the plant began to catch on as a research model.
    <p> Rédei recalled that in 1969, "the NSF [National Science Foundation] program director informed me I had to
    quit Arabidopsis if I wanted to continue to get support." Clearly he was a researcher far ahead of his time- currently there are about 18,000 Arabidopsis researchers spread across 6,800 labs.

    <A NAME="tair"><a href="/about/survey.jsp"><b>TAIR Community Survey</b></a>
    <p>The TAIR Community survey polled TAIR users to find out how well the TAIR website is serving the needs of the community and also asked for preferences for future tools and data.
    <br>
        From a total of 387 responses, some results are:<br>
        <li> TAIR was listed as 'essential' for 83% or 'very useful' for 13% of respondents.
        <li> Respondents listed work on 138 diverse organisms in addition to Arabidopsis.
        <li> Correct gene structures are the most important data type at TAIR. Closely following are seed and DNA stock information, experimentally-verfied gene function data, mutant phenotypes and insertion/polymorphism data.
        <li> Respondents would most like to see these future data types: promoters/cis elements, orthologous genes from other species, complete ecotype sequences, regulatory and genetic interactions, protein modification data, and small RNAs.
        <li> Respondents had a clear preference for developing protein-related tools: protein interaction viewer, protein domain and modification viewer, protein alignment viewer.
        <li> The method chosen to most strongly encourage users to submit data to TAIR to share with the community was to integrate the submission into the publication process. Second was improved data submission forms.
        <li> Differences between US and non-US users: US respondents were generally more satisfied with TAIR performance and data correctness.

<p> <dt>
Two academic networks were recently initiated in the UK to advance synthetic biology:
<ol>
    <li><a href="http://www.sppi-net.org/index.php"><u>SPPI-NET</u></a>- 3 year funding for the Synthetic Plant Products for Industry Network began in July, 2008.
    Using synthetic biology approaches SPPI-NET has the goal of radically re-engineering the metabolism and physiology of plants for non-food industrial applications in the chemical and materials industries.
    Collaborations between plant scientists, chemists, process engineers and modelers will seek to develop methods for producing novel synthetic products from plant metabolism.
    <p>
        <a href="http://www.sppi-net.org/wkshop1.php"><u>SPPI-NETs first workshop</u></a> will be held January 13-14, 2009 at Durham University, UK.
    <li><a href="http://www.synbiostandards.co.uk/index.php"><u>SynBioStandards</u></a>- 3 year funding for the Synthetic Biology Standards Network began in June, 2008.
    This network is also an interdisciplinary effort to bring academic researchers together, in this case focusing on developing a common language and set of tools for synthetic biology research.
    The network is not focused specifically on plants although several network members come from the plant sciences. The website lists a number of <a href="http://www.synbiostandards.co.uk/events.php"><u>relevant

A few key updates from the meeting:
<p>
<IMG SRC="/images/redball.gif"> Randy Scholl, Director of ABRC since its inception in Sept. 1991, announced plans to retire. There will be a phased
transfer of Directorship to Professor Erich Grotewold, the recently appointed Associate Director of ABRC. The transition will occur over the next 2-3 years to ensure uninterrupted
leadership and operations. Prof. Grotewold will be assisted by several experienced ABRC staff members (Luz Rivero, Emma Knee, and Debbie Crist.) Randy's leadership of the ABRC for nearly
two decades has been vital to the success of the entire Arabidopsis community. Best wishes Randy!
<li>ABRC has recently received the first set of about 8,000 artificial-microRNA (amiRNA) entry/expression clones from an <a href="http://2010.cshl.edu/"><u>NSF-funded AT2010 project</u></a> which intends to target 22,000 Arabidopsis
genes. These amiRNAs can specifically silence individual or duplicated genes or gene familiies in a dominant manner. Expression of the constructs can be inducible and limited to specific tissues. ABRC will make transformation-ready constructs
available at their usual prices as soon as they are made available and processed. The first set is currently being processed and will be available from ABRC shortly. <A HREF="mailto:abrc@osu.edu">Questions? Contact ABRC</a>

<p>The conference will open with a <a href="http://www.ciw.edu/somerville_keynote"><u>keynote lecture
by Chris Somerville on Developing Cellulosic Biofuels.</u></a> Dr. Somerville notes that the efficient production of biofuels by biologically-based routes will require innovation in three
main areas: production of feedstocks, conversion of feedstocks to sugars, and conversion of sugars to fuels. At present, the main feedstocks being used for fuel production are corn starch
and sugar from sugarcane. However, the demand for fuel vastly exceeds the amount that can be produced from these feedstocks so it is expected that gasoline and diesel replacements will
ultimately be derived from cellulosic biomass. <b>He sees that there are many opportunities to direct basic research on model organisms such as Arabidopsis directly toward outstanding problems
related to bioenergy production.</b> He feels that most importantly, because agricultural productivity is the key to making arable land available for any other purpose, research that is directed toward
improving our understanding of basic biological processes in higher plants should be viewed as fundamental to the development of biofuels and all other uses of higher plants. <b>He concludes that current
trends in federal funding for research that lead away from basic research on Arabidopsis are ill-conceived.</b>

<A NAME="text"><a href="http://www.textpresso.org/arabidopsis"><b>Textpresso scientific literature text mining tool for Arabidopsis</b></A> 
</dt>
<dt>
Textpresso is a text-mining system for scientific literature. Its two major elements are (1) access to full text, so that
entire articles can be searched, and (2) introduction of categories of biological concepts and classes that relate two objects (e.g., association, regulation, etc.) or describe one (e.g., biological process, etc). 
A search engine enables the user to search for one or a combination of these categories and/or keywords within an entire literature. The system was initially developed as part of Wormbase for <i>C. elegans</i> but
<b>more recently has been extended to additional organisms including Arabidopsis, which now has its own site</b> <a href="http://www.textpresso.org/arabidopsis">(www.textpresso.org/arabidopsis).</a> 
<br>
TAIR was heavily involved in developing the Arabidopsis Textpresso system; most of the Arabidopsis scientific literature comes from TAIR which sent around 15,000 in-house articles. In addition, TAIR provided the
Arabidopsis vocabularies and categories. <b>Currently, Textpresso for Arabidopsis contains information on these data types (data counts in parentheses): abstract (25,877), body (15,276), title (26,834), totaling  67,987 entries.</b>
<p>
The system allows users to perform targeted searches of Arabidopsis literature, for example, using gene names, GO terms, or  a combination of search terms. Up to 4 categories can be specified using pull-down menus and advanced search
options are available, such as limiting and sorting by year, author, search type (Boolean or integer), and context of search scope (by sentence or document). The results page lists literature citations containing the search query specified
and the entire set can be downloaded into Endnote, or displayed for printing or in xml format. Although the system does not provide the full text of articles it does provide abstracts, and perhaps most useful, displays several sentences
from each article that contain the search term(s). This quickly reveals the context of search terms which can help users determine the usefulness of the reference. The user can designate whether search terms are highlighted, and other
links on the results page include: reference in Endnote, reference in xml, online text (links to article or to reference), related articles (searches Pubmed), and Pubmed citation. Gene names or other entities mentioned only in the
supplementary materials will not be retrieved because these documents are not currently included in the set of documents indexed and searched by Textpresso. <i>Reference:</i><a href="http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020309">

<A NAME="ipc"><a href="http://iplantcollaborative.org/home"><b>Kickoff meeting for the iPlant Collaborative (iPC)</b></A> Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (New York), April 7-9, 2008
</dt>
<dt>
The new <a href="http://iplantcollaborative.org/home">iPlant Collaborative </a> held its kickoff conference at CSHL, a member institution of the iPC.
Over 200 participants attended with about 100 additional participants joining via direct, live participation webcast.
<br><b>Recordings from the meeting will be available to the public at the iPC website starting April 25. </b>
<p>The purpose of the conference, entitled Bringing Plant and Computing Scientists Together to Solve Plant Biologys Grand Challenges, was to both explain the project and actively engage plant biologists and computational
experts in discussions to begin identifying compelling and tractable Grand Challenge (GC) questions, and how the iPC, partnered with the community, might address them. The goal is to develop a cyberinfrastructure collaborative
for the plant sciences that will enable new conceptual advances through integrative, computational thinking.  This will be accomplished by bringing together plant biologists, computer and information scientists and engineers,
among other experts, to address GCs in the plant sciences that are proposed <b>by</b> the plant science community.
<p>
The conference started with an overview on cyberinfrastructure (CI) projects by Francine Berman (UCSD Supercomputer Center Director). According to Dr. Berman, good CI is invisible to users, science-driven, integrates well,
has planned evolution, and focuses on the user from the beginning to maximize effectiveness and usefulness. Rich Jorgensen (iPC Director, University of Arizona) next described some basic aspects of the project, including that
rather than supporting the collection of new data, existing data will be used to develop and pursue GC questions developed by the community. To identify GCs the iPC will facilitate small focused workshops for self-assembled groups
whose workshop proposal submissions are approved, and also for specific topics in plant biology, with invited participants selected to address those areas. In parallel, self-forming GC teams with sufficiently clear vision, defined
data sets, and diverse team member roles, can directly submit a GC proposal, bypassing the GC workshop stage. <i><a href="http://iplantcollaborative.org/grand-challenge-process">Read more about the GC process and workshops proposals by clicking here.</a></i>
<p>Three breakout sessions were held to begin the discussion around GC questions in plant biology. Like the rest of the conference, external participants joined via webcast. <a href="http://wiki.iplantcollaborative.org/farm/mtg042008/images/c/c1/Summary.pdf">A summary of discussions on the three sessions topics can be found here.</a>
The breakout session topics were:
<ol>
<li> Primary metabolism, physiology, and organismic biology, from molecules to whole organisms <a href="http://wiki.iplantcollaborative.org/farm/mtg042008/images/b/b6/Report_1.doc">(link to summary word document)</a>
<li> Evolution and development of form and function, from molecular, cellular and developmental biology to biodiversity, comparative biology, systematics and phylogenetics <a href="http://wiki.iplantcollaborative.org/farm/mtg042008/images/a/af/Report_2.ppt">(link to summary powerpoint file)</a>
<li> Biotic and abiotic interactions, from biochemistry and cell biology to ecosystems <a href="http://wiki.iplantcollaborative.org/farm/mtg042008/images/9/9e/Report_3.ppt"> (link to summary powerpoint file)</a>
</ol>
<img src="/i/star.jpg" width="22 px" height="19 px" alt="star" align=left> <b>Outreach:</b> I joined breakout session #2 (Biotic and abiotic interactions), and assisted the session leaders with the webcast. I also participated in the optional Education, Outreach, Training session held on the last day.
<p>Rob Last, Chair of the <a href="http://iplantcollaborative.org/about-ipc/board-of-directors"> iPC Board of Directors (BoD) </a> that oversees the project, descrubed the roles of the BoD which include acting as a go-between for the scientific community
and the iPC, conducting reviews of submitted GC proposals, and ensuring that the broad community is engaged. Dr. Last announced that the BoD hopes to begin reviewing workshop proposals as early as June 1st of this year and anticipates two rounds of reviews annually.
The iPC expects to hold up to six workshops a year to facilitate proposal development. 
<p><a href="http://iplantcollaborative.org/about-ipc/education-outreach-and-training">Education, Outreach, and Training (EOT)</a> is an important component of all aspects of the iPC. A primary mission is to enable people of all levels from K-12, small colleges and universities, all the way up to large research institutions, to access the same datasets
and use the same tools, thereby increasing broad collaboration and advancing science worldwide. All projects supported by iPC are required to have EOT components and discussion at the conference included the possibility that EOT itself could make up the core of a proposed GC.
<p>A question that came up several times was whether the iPC could directly fund researchers in the US and/or abroad to participate in the project, for data collection or in some other capacity. It was reiterated that the grant does <b>not</b> allow funds to be used for data collection,
and that in general, funds will not be used for non-iPC personnel. The iPC team is funded to develop the cyberinfrastructure that successfully approved GC proposals require. International collaboration is encouraged but compensation is limited to expenses such as travel, food, and lodging.
Dr. Last did state that there was a mechanism for personnel in approved GC groups, particularly graduate students and postdocs, to be funded for short time periods on project components directly related to the GC, including interning at the iPC. In addition to GC proposal development, the presenters
described that in the projects first year the BoD will consider proposals to develop foundational tools which have obvious benefit to the plant biology community and potentially to one or more future GCs.

<A NAME="rick"><a href="http://conferences.ucdavis.edu/charleyrick"><b>The 2nd biennial Charley Rick Symposium</b></A> UC Davis, March 13-14, 2008
</dt>
<dt> 
The Symposium, named in honor of the <a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/senate/inmemoriam/CharlesM.Rick.htm">late Charles Rick,</a> a UC Davis emeritus professor considered
to be the foremost authority on tomato genetics, focused this year on plant responses to biotic and abiotic stress. Here is a summary of a few of the ten invited
speakers who presented talks, many of whom work with Arabidopsis. 
<p>Paul Schulze-Lefert (Max Planck Institute in Cologne, Germany), the opening keynote speaker, described studies on receptor functions and defense responses of the plant
immune system to powdery mildew fungus. His dual experimental system employs single leaf nuclei of barley in conjunction with Arabidopsis mutants
to determine receptor/transcription factor interactions and their involvement in mounting an immune response. Interestingly, he described that mutations in human homologs of some of
these genes result in immune-related disorders such as Crohns disease. 
<p>
Mike Thomashow (Michigan State University, USA) spoke about studies on freezing tolerance in Arabidopsis which he hopes to translate into tomato, a freezing-intolerant species.  The CBF cold
response pathway includes genes that are rapidly cold-induced to enhance freezing tolerance, acting as master switches. He described using the <a href="http://genomica.weizmann.ac.il/">Genomica computational analysis resource</a>
(free for academic use) to develop a module network by arranging expression patterns in an iterative way. He described comparative studies that identified CBF genes in other brassicas and even tomato has 3
CBF genes that respond to cold, although attempts to overexpress Arabidopsis CBF3 in tomato did not produce cold-tolerant plants suggesting the tomato CBF regulon works differently.
<p>
Two speakers discussed calcium, an important signaling molecule involved in numerous stress responses. Janet Braam (Rice University, USA) presented work on Arabidopsis Calmodulin Like (CML) genes which may be involved in
binding calcium in plant cells. Interestingly, the CML24 mutant has increased nitric oxide levels that give increased levels of FLC, explaining the mutants defect in the switch to flowering. However, the mutant still
appears to bind calcium normally. She is currently trying to determine how CML24 regulates nitric oxide levels and has a hypothetical model that CML24 might normally inhibit nitric oxide production in mitochondria. <br>
Julian Schroeder (UC San Diego, USA) discussed recent work on mutants defective in stomatal response to carbon dioxide in leaves. The gca2 mutant responds weakly to elevated CO2 and new data demonstrate that calcium-activation and abscisic
acid (ABA) regulation of certain anion channels are disrupted as well. He described their new priming hypothesis whereby stomatal closing signals such as ABA prime stomatal-closing calcium responses. This is based on experiments where
a calcium spike didnt close stomata unless cells were pre-exposed to ABA.

<A NAME="iPlant"><a href="http://iplantcollaborative.org/home"><b>The iPlant Collaborative (iPC)</b></A>
</dt>
<dt> 
A new Plant Science Cyberinfrastructure Collaborative (PSCIC) program is being established due to a recently awarded $50 million/5 year grant from the NSF.  The goal is to develop a cyberinfrastructure collaborative for the plant sciences that
would enable new conceptual advances through integrative, computational thinking.  This will be accomplished via the iPlant Collaborative (iPC) which will bring together plant biologists, computer and information scientists and engineers, as
well as other experts, to address 'Grand Challenges' in the plant sciences. The iPC is centered at the University of Arizona (Director: Rich Jorgensen) with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Arizona State University, Purdue University, and the University of North Carolina, Wilmington, as partners.
<p>
Importantly, the iPC intends to be fluid and dynamic and community-driven. The Grand Challenge questions in plant biology will be selected by the community through a series of workshops.
<p>
<IMG SRC="/images/redball.gif"><b> The kickoff meeting</b> for the iPC will be <a href="http://meetings.cshl.edu/meetings/iplant08.shtml">April 7-9, 2008 at CSHL, New York.</a> This meeting is intended not only to bring together members of those teams already involved in iPC but to attract others interested in similar themes and goals.

<dt> <b> Key principles listed as guiding the development of the iPC: </b></dt> <UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI> To develop a cyberinfrastructure collaborative rather than purely a cyberinfrastructure
<LI> To enable multi-disciplinary teams to address grand challenges in plant science
<LI> To be an entity that is by, for and of the community
<LI> To train the next generation in computational thinking
<LI> To be able to reinvent itself as needs and technologies change
</UL> </dd>

Broader impacts of the iPC project are expected to extend beyond simply addressing grand challenge questions on a scientific level as the iPC will involve extensive community building and educational outreach.

<A NAME="PAG08"><a href="http://www.intl-pag.org/"><b>PAG XVI: The International Conference on the Status of Plant and Animal Genome Research</b></A> January 12-16, 2008 at the Town and Country Hotel in San Diego, CA</dt> 
 <br>
 The 16th PAG meeting was held again in San Diego, California. Included this year was a presentation of a new report that assessed the achievements and potential future directions of the National Plant Genome Initiative (NPGI), established in 1998 in the US as a coordinated national
plant genome project. A Committee of experts, chaired by Jeff Dangl (UNC- Chapel Hill) was convened to make the assessment and provide recommendations. The report concluded that overall the NPGI has been successful, and partnered with the NSF AT2010 program focusing on basic research in Arabidopsis,
has led to technologies and data production that form the basis of fundamental plant research. <p>
The Committee recommended that both the NPGI and AT2010 projects continue as a cooperative partnership and leverage the gains already realized. They further recommend broadening NPGIs mission to include economically relevant traits in model and crop species, deeper research into plant diversity and adaptation,
and continued translation of knowledge to breeders and farmers.
<br><b>Some specific recommendations include:</b>
<ol>
<li> Expand genome sequencing 
<li> Develop tools and resources at a high resolution for a few, carefully chosen species, and at a broader depth for additional species 
<li> Use systems-level approaches for plant modeling 
<li> Develop interoperable and evolvable computational tools
<li> Invest in comparative genomics and metagenomics to better understand plant environments
<li> Enable translation of basic plant genomics to the field, i.e. from model to crop species
<li> Improve training and recruitment of the best broadly-trained young scientists, including from outside of plant biology-related fields
<li> Promote outreach on plant genomics to educate the public on the value of such research

<dt><A NAME="2020"><b>2020 Vision for Biology Workshop: The role of plants in addressing grand challenges: Arlington, Virginia (Jan. 3-4, 2008)</b></A></dt><br>
I joined 14 other US and 2 international members of the Arabidopsis community for an NSF-sponsored workshop to identify Grand Challenges in Biology and the role of plants in general,
and Arabidopsis in particular, in addressing them. The goal of the workshop was to be forward-looking about the direction of Biology research in the next decade and to discuss where plant biology,
Arabidopsis, and model organisms fit into this larger vision.
<p>
Members of the UK and German Arabidopsis communities are planning to hold a joint discussion in June, 2008. In addition, MASC members are tentatively planning to hold further discussion on the
topic at the 19th International Conference on Arabidopsis Research in Montreal this July. At the July meeting recommendations from the planning workshops are expected to be presented as part
of the larger discussion by the international Arabidopsis community. The goal of these workshops and discussions is to develop ideas for the direction of future Arabidopsis research as well as
exchange information between international groups. Recommendations will be relayed to appropriate members of each country's funding agencies for consideration.

The <a href="http://www.plant-gems.org/pages/home.php"> Plant Genomics European Meetings (PlantGEM)</a> bring together primarily European plant researchers focused on crops and model plants. Arabidopsis thaliana was well-represented with over half the invited talks involving Arabidopsis studies. In addition to basic research presentations there were sessions on Agricultural Sustainability, Health-related Plant Genomics, and Industries in Plant Genomics. There were also parallel events including workshops on Triticeae genomics and European Plant Genomics initiatives, and the 2nd Workshop of the International Steering Committee on Plant Genomics (ISCPG).  
<br>
The ISCPG workshop included presentations by international plant genomics consortia members (e.g. barley, soybean, sugarcane, brassica, solanaceae) followed by discussion on funding and collaboration opportunities. Arabidopsis thaliana, the plant species at the most advanced stage of research and resources, was presented by Philip Benfey (Duke University) and past MASC chair.
<p>
<img src="/i/star.jpg" width="22 px" height="19 px" alt="star" align=left><b>Outreach:</b> I prepared a presentation about the history, structure, and past, present and future goals of the MASC for Philip to present at the ISCPG workshop. <A HREF="/portals/masc//MASC_PlantGEMs2007.pdf">Click to download the MASC presentation in PDF format (82 KB).</a>
<br>A major part of current planning by the MASC involves holding workshops to discuss post-2010 Arabidopsis research. U.S. researchers expect to hold a workshop in January, 2008, followed by similar workshops in the UK and Germany. At the request of Philip Benfey I helped develop the funding proposal for the U.S. workshop and will help organize the event including participating as an observer. I plan to facilitate a larger discussion by the international community during the <a href="http://www.plantconferences.org/Arabidopsis2008/">Annual Arabidopsis Conference in Montreal, Canada (July 23-27, 2008.)</a> 
<p>
<dt> Notes from selected talks at PlantGEMs</dt> <UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>Timothy Hall (European Commission) spoke of the <a href="http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/home_en.html">Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)</a>, a new 7 year initiative whose 1.9 billion+ Euro budget will have about 40% for life sciences. The budget for FP7 is 40% greater than FP6 and includes significant funding for plant biology (30-50% of Life Sciences funding) and places new emphasis on International collaboration. The FP7 theme involving food, agriculture, and biotechnology is especially relevant to plant biologists and includes funding for new uses of plants such as for alternative energy sources, bioremediation, biopolymers, etc. A theme involving biotechnology will support genome sequencing, complex processes, systems biology, and other related topics.
<LI>Justin Borevitz (University of Chicago) described efforts by his lab and colleagues in developing a high resolution haplotype map for 384 wild A. thaliana genomes using oligo arrays for genome sequencing. The <a href="http://naturalvariation.org/hapmap">HapMap Project</a> will determine 250,000 SNPs, provide insight on natural variation, and examine flowering time across two seasonal and two geographic environments which span the native range of <i>A. thaliana.</i>  
<LI>Willi Gruissem (ETH Zurich) and colleagues want to use proteome data to improve genome annotation. The <a href=http://www.mop.uzh.ch/databases.html>Arabidopsis Peptide Atlas</a> database, expected to be available by the end of 2007, involves analysis of the entire Arabidopsis proteome and will include mass spectrometry data and other protein information. So far they have identified close to 16,000 Arabidopsis proteins. Willi says that the data can confirm new ORFs and that over 60 new genomic loci were identified this way.
<LI>Mark Stitt (MPIMP-Golm) discussed genomics analysis of Arabidopsis nutrient responses and stated that it is critical for experiments to be described adequately so that computers can extract important parts for comparison. He mentioned a web-based tool that will be available in several months for tracking experimental conditions. A currently available tool, <a href=http://mapman.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/pageman/>PageMan</a>, allows analysis of a series of gene expression datasets such as timecourses or treatments, including statistical analysis and visualization graphics. <LI>Ute Kramer (University of Heidelberg) gave an update on her work examining metal homeostasis in the metal hyperaccumulator Arabidopsis halleri, a relative of A. thaliana, and close relative of A. lyrata. An understanding of why A. halleri can tolerate 30 fold more zinc and 10 fold more cadmium than A. thaliana may be useful in bioremediation of contaminated soil. Ute discussed HMA4, which encodes a metal ATPase involved in metal efflux, found to be very highly expressed in A. halleri compared to A. thaliana.  She showed that HMA4 is needed by A. halleri for zinc and cadmium hypertolerance and zinc hyperaccumulation, and that its high expression appears to cause partitioning of zinc predominantly in the shoots in A. halleri (vs. roots of A. thaliana) <a href=http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/content/full/142/1/148> Reference: Plant Phys article, 2006.</a>

<img src="/i/SeedSymp.jpg" alt="Seeds" width="82 px" height="137 px" align=left hspace=5>This first annual international <a href="http://www.plantsciences.ucdavis.edu/seedsymposium2007">Plant Sciences Symposium</a> was held September 17-20, 2007 at the University of California Davis.
The symposium was designed to advance the growing knowledge of seed biology and its application in agriculture. The meeting organizers opened by stating that seeds provide 75% of foods consumed by man
and therefore research into basic and applied seed biology is critical to meet the growing global demand for food. Furthermore, it is imperative that discoveries can be adapted and translated to the marketplace.

<p>The opening speaker, Rob Horsch from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, spoke of that groups participation in the recently initiated Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) chaired by former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. 
<a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/GlobalDevelopment/Agriculture/RelatedInfo/AfricanFarmers.htm">AGRA</a> is focused on developing seeds to attain the best yields in the diverse environments of
Africa and working to make sure they are delivered to farmers who need them most. <br>A number of talks described exciting advances in increasing seed yield and tolerance to stress, experiments started in Arabidopsis
and then moved into crops such as canola, soybean and corn. Other speakers addressed using seeds for molecular farming and health: SemBioSys initiated Arabidopsis experiments to produce human growth hormone and insulin
and then moved to safflower for production. The company expects to begin human trials for plant-produced insulin in 2008. DuPont and Calgene have both engineered soybeans to produce omega 3-fatty acids alternatives
to fish oils and are engaged in bringing their products to market.
<p>
In one of the many basic research talks, Roger Beachy (Danforth Center) described a gene switching technology that will be of interest to many scientists, which is an alternative to hormone, heat-shock, or ethanol-based inducible systems.
The system uses the ecdysone receptor, a DNA binding domain, and a transcription factor activator driven by a seed-specific promoter. Upon addition of the ligand (methoxyfenozide) the receptor binds the target gene and induces expression.
He sees a big advantage to the system because the ligand is safe and can be bought off-the-shelf. This technology is available to the public for research use (see Koo et al (2004) <a href="http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-313X.2003.01869.x">

<p>
The Symposium's banquet speaker was Jorge Mayer from Freiburg, Germany who spoke about <a href="http://www.goldenrice.org/"><i>Golden Rice</i></a>, developed to produce high levels of beta-carotene in a primary
food source to alleviate vitamin A deficiency-related diseases prevalent in developing countries. Golden Rice has met with resistance from those suspicious of genetically modified crops resulting in its inability to be distributed widely. The creators of the technology
have donated it for humanitarian use in developing countries, free of charge.

I went to the Sutton Bonington campus of the University of Nottingham in England where I visited Sean May and colleagues
at the <a href="http://arabidopsis.info/">Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC)</a>.
<br>
<img src="/i/suttonfields.jpg" width="136 px" height="102 px" alt="Sutton Fields House" align=left hspace=5>Sean booked me a room at a
beautiful old estate house (circa 1850) converted to a bed and breakfast, and the next morning I walked to NASC, the primary distribution site for Arabidopsis-related stocks to
European scientists. NASC and the Arabidopsis Biological Stock Center (ABRC) based in Ohio, USA, work in close collaboration to share resources so that researchers
worldwide have easy access to plant (and also DNA) stocks.
<img src="/i/nasc.jpg" width="132 px" height="98 px" alt="NASC" align=right hspace=5> NASC also provides quite a variety of computational resources
including the ever-expanding NASCArrays microarray datasets and the AtEnsembl genome browser which is chock-full of useful features such as
multiple annotations, EST and cDNA alignments, insertion lines (which you just click to order), protein alignments, BLAST searching, and the
newly added SNP data from 20 natural Arabidopsis accessions. NASC provides microarray services, and data are
eventually deposited into the publicly-accessible <a href="http://affymetrix.arabidopsis.info/narrays/experimentbrowse.pl">NASCArrays.</a> Sean gave me a tour of new NASC facilities and described how the microarray team has become so
efficient that they have passed on significant cost reductions to the community (current ATH1 arrays have been reduced to 350 GBP). 
<p>
<img src="/i/star.jpg" width="22 px" height="19 px" alt="star" align=left> <b>Outreach:</b> The next morning I spoke with Charlie Hodgman, director of the newly established <a href="http://www.cpib.info/">Centre for Plant Integrative Biology (CPIB)</a>.
The Centre employs a multi-faceted systems biology approach to model and study the Arabidopsis root, with future plans to develop the research into crop species.
I described the relevant efforts of the <a href="/portals/masc/Subcommittees.jsp#sysbio">MASC Systems Biology Subcommittee</a>,
and in fact, the Subcommittee Chair, Philip Benfey (Duke University), has been involved as an external advisor to CPIB during its development. 

<p>
CPIB plans to integrate their efforts with other international projects
such as <a href="http://www.agron-omics.eu/">AGRON-OMICS</a>, which investigates Arabidopsis leaf growth (Coordinated by Pierre Hlson, MASC member from Ghent University),and <a href="http://www.computableplant.org/">The Computable Plant Project</a>,
which studies Arabidopsis meristem development. The combined efforts of many partners is expected to lead to development of a generic computer model of a plant which will be used to advance crop and plant science.
In a truly interdisciplinary effort the Centre strives to bring together biologists,
computer scientists, engineers, mathematicians and others to both develop and test models of root elongation, cell division, and lateral root
formation. The first phase of the project has already begun: elucidating root elongation. Information on <a href="http://cpib.info/jobs.shtml">Jobs and Fellowships</a>

my current planning efforts for Montreal in 2008. We discussed various meeting formats and logistical issues and I passed along data I've accumulated about
conferences held in the past 5 years to aid GARNet in their planning.
<p>During the meeting, <b>Edinburgh, Scotland</b> was officially chosen as the conference location and the date is <b>June 30-July 4, 2009.</b>
In preparation for the 2009 conference I've set aside an exhibitor booth at the Montreal Arabidopsis conference (in 2008) and invited GARNet members to come advertise
and drum up excitement for the meeting in Scotland.

there were a number of interesting talks many of which involve integrating modeling with
experimentation, including efforts to model auxin and the shoot apical meristem (Jan Traas, France), a virtual root, part of a new systems
biology thrust in the UK (Malcolm Bennett, UK), elucidating leaf growth (Pierre Hilson, Belgium), cell walls for bioenergy (Simon Turner and
Kerrie Farrar, UK), all the way to the entire Virtual Plant (Rodrigo Gutierrez, Chile.) Another major session was dedicated to recent advances
in Arabidopsis-pathogen interactions, and there were talks about efforts to develop Brachypodium distachyon into the model for grasses and
bioenergy (Mike Bevan, UK), and to elucidate functions for the roughly 4,500 remaining Arabidopsis genes still labeled as being of unknown function
(Chris Town, US).

<img src="/i/star.jpg" width="22 px" height="19 px" alt="star" align=left> <b>Outreach:</b> Through a poster presentation I shared information about the
MASC, efforts in Arabidopsis research, the recent Arabidopsis meeting held in Beijing and plans for next year's meeting in Montreal.
I also described the emphasis on translational research in the <a href="/portals/masc/2007_MASC_Report.pdf">most recent MASC report.</a>
My take-home messages from the trip were: integration isnt only for calculus (systems biology is here and,
with bioinformatics, is crucial to the future of biology), developing alternative energy sources is still in the early phases but must be pursued,
and the British love crisps and chips (or, chips and fries, as we know them in the US).
