<b>Comparative Genomics</b> <I>Arabidopsis</I> is a small part of our genetic
diversity, and is part of a new research center here <a href="http://www.evolutionarygenomics.dk/comparativegenomics/">
www.evolutionarygenomics.dk/comparativegenomics
</a>.
<br><b>Disease Resistance</b>-  We use functional genomic approaches to study
genes mediating physiological and developmental processes. One mutant we
have used as a tool is an insertion line exhibiting recessive dwarfism due
to transposon inactivation of the MAP Kinase 4 gene. Current work includes:
analyses of MPK4 substrates including MKS1, transcriptomic analyses of downstream
MPK4 effectors, and the relation of MPK4 and homologs to other signaling
pathways.<br>
<b>Programmed Cell Death</b>- Another insertion produced the Accelerated Cell
Death 11 mutant (acd11) that exhibits characteristics of animal apoptosis
monitored by flow cytometry, and acd11 constitutively expresses defense-related genes
that accompany the hypersensitive response normally triggered by avirulent pathogens.
Current work includes: selection and analyses of suppressors and effectors of PCD, analyses
of ACD11 interacting proteins, and functions of ACD11 homologs in plants
and animals. 
<br><b>Hormonal control & bioluminescent transgenes</b>- We also use fusion genetic
strategies to identify signaling components involved in the regulation of
gene expression in response to JA or gibberellin (GA). Towards this end,
 promoter sequences of  the 1) JA-inducible LOX1,  2) GA- responsive GASA1, or
3) GA-repressible GA20Oxidase (GA5) were fused to both the E. coli GUS and
firefly luciferase (LUC) reporters. These constructs were transfered to
plants and their expression shown to be appropriately regulated by the
hormones. These plants were then mutagenized and progeny screened for
trans-signaling mutants that inappropriately express both reporters and
the endogenous GASA1, GA5 or LOX1 genes.  These screens and genes involved
in GA and JA signaling identified by positional cloning. 
<p><b>Resources</b>&#239;&#191;&#189; What made <i>Arabidopsis</i> worth studying was free,

<b>SNARE proteins in disease resistance</b>
<br>
We have identified roles of the <I>Arabidopsis</I> syntaxin genes <I>SYP121</I> and
<I>SYP122</I> in disease resistance. Through our discovery of the mutants <I>pen1-1</I>
and <I>pen1-2</I>, we identified <I>SYP121 (=PEN1</I>) to be required for penetration resistance
against powdery mildew fungi (Collins et al., 2003; Assaad et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2007).
During penetration resistance, observed when fungi attack directly through the plant
epidermis cell wall, a local apposition (often termed &#239;&#191;&#189;papilla&#239;&#191;&#189;) is formed on the
inner side of the cell wall at the site of penetration. We predict that processes
of this papilla formation are <I>SYP121</I>-dependent (Assaad et al., 2004).
<br>We subsequently described that simultaneous mutation of the genes <I>SYP121</I> and
<I>SYP122</I> causes the plants to develop a lesion mimic phenotype, mediated by strong
activation of several defence signalling pathways. This shows that <I>SYP121</I> and <I>SYP122</I>
 are negative regulators of these signalling pathways, which includes the salicylic acid (SA),
jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET)-pathways, as well as a pathway leading to a
&#239;&#191;&#189;hypersensitive response&#239;&#191;&#189; (HR)-like defence that provides complete resistance to the
powdery mildew fungus, <I>Erysiphe cichoracearum</I> (Zhang et al., 2007).

Description of the research project
</b>
<br>Research is focused on sequential assembly processes and 
regulatory pathways that govern the biogenesis, performance 
and acclimation of macromolecular photosynthetic protein 
complexes in the thylakoid membrane. Identification and role 
of translocon components, molecular chaperones and other 
folding factors in the thylakoid membrane, in stroma and in 
the thylakoid lumen during translation, insertion and 
assembly of chloroplast-encoded thylakoid membrane proteins 
are being addressed by proteome approaches. We also study the 
mechanisms how the environmental and metabolic cues modulate 
thylakoid redox reactions and thereby relay information 
signals to both the chloroplast own genome and the nuclear 
genome, ultimately leading to acclimation of plants to a 
changed environment.

<b>Molecular analysis of cold acclimation

<br>Our general aim is to characterize components in

obtain knowledge of the components involved in signaling and 
their role in the signaling network.

likely to be involved in low temperature signaling. These 
genes will be used directly to assess their role in 
activation of low temperature responsive genes and

<b>Plants and heavy metal tolerance mechanisms
</b>
<br>
The main object of genetic and proteomic profiling, the 
hyperaccumulator plant 
<I>Thlaspi caerulescens
</I>, belongs to the same taxonomic family (Cruciferae) as 
<I>Arabidopsis thaliana
</I>. Because the 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> genome has been completely sequenced recently, we can 
have a full benefit of those data for the identification of 
genes and proteins from 
<I>Thlaspi
</I>. The specific aim is to isolate and characterize 
putative genes and proteins conferring metal 
hyperaccumulation and tolerance traits. Interesting candidate 
genes are further examined for their function in yeast and 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Unintended effects in genetically modified plants 
</b>
<br>One of the key issues in the risk assessment of GM crop 
plants is whether unexpected hazardous metabolic 
perturbations (so-called unintended effects) may have taken 
place in the plant due to genetic modification, affecting its 
safety as food or nutritional status. In the EU V Framework 
project GMOCARE our laboratory is responsible for the 
proteomics part of the work, some of which has been performed 
with genetically modified 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> plants.

<b>Signal Networks Controlling Adaptive Responses In Plants
</b>
<br>The long-term aim of our research is to elucidate the 
signal pathways and networks that control plant responses to 
environmental and developmental stimuli as well as ascribe 
the function of the key regulators as well as key response 
proteins and metabolites. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Cold acclimation.
</b> A central theme in our studies is to understand the 
molecular communication between higher plants and their 
environment using abiotic stresses (cold/drought and 
photoperiod) as models. The focus is on molecular analysis of 
cold acclimation in 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I>. 
<br>
<b>Plant-pathogen interaction.
</b> A major theme in this research is elucidation of signals 
and signal pathways involved in plant defense responses. Systemic genome 
wide analysis is currently employed to identify the central 
components of plant defense signaling and PCD development. 
Additionally we are focused on identification of plant 
receptors for the elicitors produced or released by the 
action of the pathogen by activation tagging.
<br>
<b>Cross talk between the signal pathways.
</b> Our current research is 
focused on characterizing some of the central nodes of stress signaling 
networks. These 
efforts are greatly facilitated by genetic and genomic 
techniques in particular using 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> mutant collections, expression profiling and 
overexpression or RNAi silencing in transgenic plants.

<b>Chloroplast redox reactions in plant development and acclimation:</b> <br>


Environmental variables modify the performance of plant chloroplast and
thereby also initiate acclimatizing signal transduction pathways.
Photosynthetic light reactions activate a specific set of redox
components, which subsequently regulate the chloroplast function.
Recently it has been proposed that the particular redox reactions are
also involved in regulation of gene expression by initiating signal
transduction between the chloroplast and the nucleus. Our research aims
at studying the role of the redox components in chloroplast and in the
signalling processes including enzymes of protein phosphorylation, thiol
regulators and reactive oxygen species.

We use 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> currently for two purposes. Firstly, we are measuring 
the action spectrum of photoinhibition of Photosystem II in 
the npq4-1 and npq1-2 mutants of Krishna Niyogi. If the 
chlorophyll antenna of PSII is the photoreceptor of visible-
light-induced photoinhibition, then the action spectrum of 
npq4-1 is expected to have a higher peak in the red region 
than found in the spectrum of the wild type. The action 
spectrum of non-photochemical excitation quenching is also 
under construction. Our second 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I>-related topic is to develop improved methods for 
screening of 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> (or any other) mutants by using kinetic chlorophyll 
fluorescene imaging. Our idea is to use the information 
content of the whole fluorescence induction curve instead of 
measuring the fluorescence intensity at specific points. This 
research is starting in cooperation with Olli Nevalainen from 
the department of information technology, Turku, and Ladja 
Nedbal from Nove Hrady, Czech Republic.

<p>We are studying plant metabolism with an emphasis on 
respiration, in particular interactions between chloroplasts 
and mitochondria in actively photosynthesizing cells. Also 
metabiolc adjustments during stress and acclimation to low 
temperature are under investigation. 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> with antisense and and sense constructs of key enzymes 
are used. We have also started to use a proteomics approach 
to follow changes in mitochondria during low temperature 
stress and senescence.

We are studying the structure and function of the light 
harvesting antenna and its role in regulation of 
photosynthesis. The focus is on the proteins in the LHC 
supergene family, the proteins encoded by the Lhca and Lhcb 
genes and related proteins such as PsbS, Elip, HLIP etc. We 
have created specific antibodies against all the Lhc, and 
some of the other, and obtained transgenic lines lacking many 
of the the individual proteins, and characterize these lines 
using a variety of techniques, to determine the functions of 
the protein subunits and their positions and structural roles 
in the complexes. In this, we collaborate with several groups 
with special compentence to analyse photosynthetic 
performance.

<b>Control of Biotic and Abiotic Stress Responses in Plants
</b>
<br>Light is a predominant factor controlling plant growth, 
development and stress responses. Therefore any biotic stress 
response in plants will be specifically adjusted by the 
prevailing light condition.
Projects in the group are aimed to understand the roles of 
light perception, the chloroplast and photooxidative stress 
in disease resistance mechanisms in the model plant 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I>. We would like to characterize excess light induced 
systemic acquired acclimation (SAA) versus pathogen induced 
systemic acquired resistance (SAR). We are testing pathogen 
related mutants (<I>lsd1, eds1, pad4, cpr1, 5, 6, ein2</I> 
and <I>sid2</I> and others) in acclimatory responses to high 
and excess light. Similarly, we are analysing photooxidative 
stress tolerant and sensitive mutants (<I>cao, gpx7, rax1-2, 
cry1, npl1</I>), in response to pathogen infection. We are 
using a combination of genetic, molecular, biochemical and 
biophysical approaches to understand how these proteins 
perform their respective roles in plant defence and 
acclimatory responses, and discover which cellular processes 
they alter. 
<br>Projects in the group are also aimed to understand and 
distinguish the roles of mesophyll, bundle sheath and stomata 
guard cells in a holistic approach to plant defence and 
acclimatory responses. 
</p>
<p>Research projects in the group are supported by Swedish 
and EU Foundations.

We are interested in plant-pest interactions and biotic stress in plants
with the long term goal to improve Brassica crop plant resistance.
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> is used in comparative studies with <I>Brassica napus</I>. We
investigate the role of the myrosinase-glucosinolate system as well as
other defense factors such as oxylipins. Functional genomics tools,
classical genetics, transformation and TAIR/NASC resources are used
together with biochemistry, cell biology and recombinant technology to
study the role of various proteins. Gene families are common and we want
to understand the role of different gene family members especially of
myrosinases and epoxide hydrolases.

<p>Our research is focused on the structure and function of 
the plant plasma membrane. 
<br>
Another project is the role of phosphoinositides in cell 
signalling. Most of the phosphoinositide metabolizing enzymes 
are found in the plasma membrane (some of the encoded by 7-11 
different genes in 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I>). We are investigating their expression and regulation, 
and their involvement in responses to external signals.
<br>We use 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> plants and cell suspension cultures in our 
investigations. We are experts in the plasma membrane 
isolation procedure using aqueous polymer two-phase 
partitioning.

Our project deals with the elucidation of perception, signal 
transduction and mechansims for tolerance against UV--B 
stress in plants, primarily 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I>, but also <I>Pisum sativum</I>. The reason for studying 
UV-B stress is of course the fact that our globe is the 
victim of man-inflicted destruction of the stratospheric 
ozone layer, which in turn leads to increased influx of 
harmful UV-B radiation (280-315 nm) to the surface of our 
planet.
