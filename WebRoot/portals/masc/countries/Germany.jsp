<p>Research on 
<I>Arabidopsis thaliana
</I> has a long history in Germany and  many individual 
research groups have been using this plant for analysis of 
specific topics in plant biology. Furthermore, individual 
groups and German members of the European sequencing 
consortia contributed to the analysis of the Genome structure 
and its sequencing. Functional 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> Genome analysis has recently received strong support in 
Germany through the implementation of two major research 
programs supported by the 
<A HREF="http://www.bmbf.de/en/">
German Ministry for Education and Research
</A> (BMBF) and the 
<A HREF="http://www.dfg.de/english/">
German Research Foundation
</A> (DFG). The aims and the contents of these two programs 
will be presented in the following paragraphs.
</p>  
<p>In 1999, the German plant genome program 
<A HREF="http://www.gabi.de">
GABI
</A> was initiated with the aim of strengthening plant genome 
research in Germany, establishing a network of competence 
including public and private research groups and business 
companies, enhancing international collaboration, and 
enhancing transfer of knowledge into application. GABI is the 
acronym for "Genome Analysis in the Plant Biological System". 
The 
<A HREF="http://www.bmbf.de/en/">
German Ministry for Education and Research
</A> (ca. 90% contribution) and private business companies 
(ca. 10% contribution) provide the financial support for the 
GABI programme. Within the GABI initiative, ca. 50% of the 
total volume of about 50 million Euro spent through a period 
of 4 years are devoted to work on the model system 
<I>Arabidopsis thaliana
</I>. In GABI, a one-programme-thesis is followed with 
respect to plant genome research. The direct interlocking of 
research on the model organism(s) and the transfer of these 
results to crops plants is a fundamental principle of this 
initiative. 
<A HREF="http://www.gabi.de/neu/bekanntmachungen/index_e.html">
Established rules
</A> regulate the disclosure and the use of research results 
obtained though GABI activities.
</p>
<p>A major aim of GABI is the establishment and support of 
international co-operations. Development of a network that 
links the various national activities is of particular 
relevance in Europe owing to the splintered structure of the 
European research area. A first step towards setting up 
direct collaborative efforts in Europe are joint research 
projects between the French plant genome program, 
<A HREF="http://www.genoplante.org/">
G&#233;noplante
</A> and the German 
<A HREF="http://www.gabi.de/">
GABI
</A> initiative. Here, the model plant 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> serves as the frontrunner and provides a model for 
international cooperation. The first joint projects will 
start within this year.
</p> 
<p>In addition to the GABI program funded by the BMBF, 
another initiative taken about one year ago has attracted 
attention in Germany. The 
<A HREF=" http://www.dfg.de/english/">
Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft
</A> (DFG) - German Research Foundation - has set links to 
the US 
<A HREF="http://www.nsf.gov/">
National Science Foundation
</A> (NSF) in order to support in a co-ordinated fashion 
projects on 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> functional genome analysis. AFGN, the

</A>, in order to achieve the enormous goal of elucidating 
the function of all 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> genes within the next ten years. This will undoubtedly 
only be possible if further programmes / activities running or initiated in other countries will enter in and 
participate.

</p>
<p>To build up resources for efficient progress in plant 
genomics, a set of 
<I>Arabidopsis thaliana
</I> T-DNA mutagenised lines with insertions sites identified 
by DNA sequencing is being generated. Columbia-0, the 
sequenced accession, was used as recipient for 
transformation. The resulting FSTs (flanking sequence tags) 
are mapped to the 
<I>A. thaliana
</I> genome using BLAST, and the corresponding locus (gene) 
annotation is deduced. The results are integrated into a FST 
database describing which genes have been disrupted. Users 
can search the database for lines containing the KO allele 
which suites their needs. Finally, T2 seeds of single lines 
are delivered after in-house confirmation of the insertion 
locus.
</p> 
<p>The goal of the project is to analyse 70.000 lines. 
GABI-KAT used a special Ti-based binary vector employing the 
sulfadiazine resistance marker to allow selection of 
transformed plants in the green house (Reiss 
<I>et al
</I>. (1996), PNAS 
<B>93
</B>:3094). All steps from selection of resistant T1 plants 
to sequencing of PCR fragments representing insertion sites 
were optimised and integrated into an analysis pipeline. The 
throughput is about 700 lines per week, with greenhouse space 
as the limiting factor. A test experiment on several hundred 
lines indicated that the left border amplifications were more 
efficient and produced considerably more FSTs compared to 
those obtained with the right border. Segregation analysis 
using the resistance marker showed that 66% of the lines 
contain an insertion at only one genetic locus. The 
confirmation rate of insertions in the T2 generation is 
presently 78% of all initially detected gene hits.

generate affinity-purified protein from each clone using high 
throughput automation: the proteins will in turn be spotted 
at high density onto membranes and latter at very high 
density onto glass (protein chips), providing a low-cost 
resource for in vitro studies of protein-protein and protein-

constitute a most useful resource in providing ready-made

which prove refractory to expression here will be handed to

mass fingerprints (MPF's) for each gene products already 
available and matching them with the MPF from a particular 
2-DE spot. In barley we expect to be able to identify 
fingerprinted proteins in an analogous manner via the partial 
sequence information provided by EST and OFP data to be 
produced in collaboration with GABI-Seed, and by direct 
"Bridge" comparisons with mass spectrometric data of 
recombinant proteins from Subproject 1. High throughput 
sample preparation and subsequent MALDI-MS methods will be

<p>Establishment of new wild type varieties, F2 populations, 
recombinant inbred lines (RILs), and genetic substitution 
lines (near isogenic lines, NILs).
</p>
<p>This project is devoted to the generation of new genetic 
resources for the functional analysis of the 
<I>Arabidopsis thaliana
</I> genome. Main emphasis is put on the creation of genetic 
variants, which, besides loss-of-function mutations, may 
carry change-of-function and gain-of-function mutations. 
Recent work, e.g. on plant-pathogen interactions, flower 
induction, seed dormancy, physiological characteristics, and 
nutrient efficiency, provided clear evidence for the 
increasing importance of the analysis of natural genetic 
diversity developed under selective pressure. To provide the 
means to efficiently evaluate the genetic diversity provided 
by the large collection of available accessions (ecotypes), 
F2 populations will be generated from unified varieties 
propagated through a single seed passage. 20 "genotype A" x 
"genotype B" (reciprocal) combinations will be generated per 
year and F2 seeds will be bulked and distributed for 
evaluation by co-operating groups. Based on pre-existing 
experience and on information accumulated through the 
evaluation of the provided F2 populations, varieties will be 
selected for the generation of new recombinant inbred lines 
(RILs). Thus, single F2 progeny plants (about 400 per variety 
combination) will be propagated as single seed descents to 
the F8 generation. One "variety A" x "variety B" combination 
per year will be selected and processed. The resulting RILs 
will be amplified and genotyped by evaluation of at least 100 
genetic markers. This will primarily be done through 
application of the SNP-based marker systems developed in the 
accompanying project. The genotype data will be deposited and 
made available through the central databases, and the RILs 
will be distributed as seed stocks for specific phenotypic 
analysis by co-operating groups.
</p>
<p>An advanced level of evaluation of the genetic diversity 
provided by the various genotypes will be possible if only 
single short fragments are substituted between genotypes. 
Thus, for one selected genotype combination (C24 x Col), NILs 
will be generated from F1s by repeated back-crossing and 
monitoring of the genetic constitution. In is this way, a set 
of ca. 100 NILs will be created, each of which with a single 
substituted DNA segment of about 5 cM / 1.3 Mbp. Also this 
work will strongly be supported by the development of the 
SNP-based marker systems which provide the means for 
mulitplexed marker analysis. As for the RILs, the information 
on the genetic constitution will be deposited and made 
available through the central databases and the developed 
lines will be distributed as seed stocks.

<p>A very large fraction of genetic variants carry (point) 
mutations or other minor sequence variations that may lead to 
change of function or gain of function of the gene products. 
They constitute one of the most important classes of mutants 
for a functional genome analysis program. To support gene 
identification we will generate SNP markers and develop 
techniques for mutation detection / mutation scanning. Such a 
system can be applied to fine-mapping of induced mutations or 
QTLs.
<p>
<p>SNPs will be identified among several different 
<I>Arabidopsis thaliana
</I> genotypes. In this phase of the project, we will focus 
on 5 (6) varieties, namely Col-0, (Ler), Cvi, C24, Nd, and 
Ei-2 which are most frequently used as standard laboratory 
strains for mutagenesis experiments, genomic sequencing, set-
up of mapping populations and/or which have been selected on 
the basis of particularly great phenotypic or genotypic 
differences. Col-0 serves as the standard genotype per se. 
Using the 5 (6) varieties we will identify 1.300 SNPs. This 
set shall be composed of (1) a framework set of ca. 100 SNPs 
evenly spaced (in terms of physical distance) throughout the 
genome and (2) ca. 1,200 SNPs between the framework (SNP) 
markers to reach an average density of about 1 SNP per 100 
kb.
</p>
<p>To this end, ca. 100 evenly spaced sites (at about 1.3 Mbp 
distances) will be selected from the physical map / the 
genome sequence and 500 bp fragments will be PCR-amplified 
and (re-)sequenced for the different varieties. The 
participating groups will use complementary strategies, 
genomic re-sequencing and EST sequnecing to identify the 
additional large number of (randomly distributed) SNPs. The 
SNP information collected will be regularly exchanged between

groups and to the public through a newly estblished SNP

to establish a multi-parallel, high efficiency SNP detection

<p>Projects in this network aim to achieve classification of 
the function of whole protein communities by genome-wide 
analyses. Starting with proteins of known or suspected 
functions, defined in a broad sense (e.g. membrane 
transporters, channels, plastid proteins, kinases, 
transcription factors), the corresponding gene or transcript 
information will be used to identify mutants in 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I>, or generate transgenic lines that are altered in the 
activity of these proteins. Combined biochemical and 
physiological analyses will then help to determine the true 
function of each protein and/or family of proteins. The 
projects in this network reflect the different protein 
communities. Interactions between proteins that are expected 
or uncovered during the project period will naturally lead to 
powerful co-operations between the various groups involved, 
and through sophisticated analyses will disclose and 
integrate novel protein functions.
</p>
<p>Protein communities will be addressed at:
<DD>- the level of compartmentation/ intracell- ular protein 
networks and
<br>- the level of transcriptional regulatory networks, which 
link different signal transduction cascades starting at the 
cellular membrane to the activity of genes.
</DD>
</p> 
<p>The proposed approaches will supply large pools of clones 
for studies on protein-protein as well as protein-DNA 
interactions, and they will employ a large spectrum of 
disciplines, including molecular genetics, biochemistry, 
genomics, proteomics, robotics and bioinformatics.
</p>
<p>Compared to the analyses of total genomic or transcribed 
information initiated world-wide, we see competitive 
advantage in establishing traps based on functional 
selection. With the laboratories collaborating in this 
network, the increasing importance and simultaneously 
increasing complexity of the analyses downstream of nucleic 
acid sequences is in the hands of internationally recognised 
experts and will provide a cutting edge in the world-wide 
activities.

<p>In most biochemical pathways solute transport into or out 
of a cell (or cell compartments) represents a strategic 
checkpoint for the metabolic state and development of a 
plant. This project focuses on functional genomics approaches 
leading to the identification, classification, and functional 
characterization of 
<I>Arabidopsis thaliana
</I> membrane proteins (plasma, plastidic, mitochondrial 
membranes and tonoplast) involved in sensing and transport. 
Many of these proteins will be critically involved in 
response and tolerance reactions of plants to environmental 
challenges (water-, salt-, temperature-stress, uptake of 
nutrients, chemical plant protection agents, pollutants, 
toxins, etc). Their functional characterization will pave the 
way for novel biotechnological applications in plant 
breeding, eventually enabling the development of 
agronomically important crop varieties with novel or improved 
properties.
</p>
<p>The experimental strategies followed include:
<OL TYPE=A>
<LI>
<I>in silico
</I> Transporter Gene Identification
<br>An important goal of this project is the identification 
and functional characterization of novel transporter 
proteins. Using a variety of bioinformatical tools (BLAST 
homology searches, hydrophobicity plots, etc.) we will scan 
the 
<A HREF="http://ukcrop.net/agr/">

<I>Arabidopsis
</I> Genome Database
</A> to identify putative novel membrane proteins having one 
or more membrane spanning domains. These candidates appearing 
from this scanning procedure will be compared to known 
membrane proteins and classified, thereby enabling us to make 
a meaningful priority decision about which proteins will be 
functionally characterized in detail.
<LI>Functional Complementation of Yeast Mutants
<br>Yeast complementation has been the breakthrough 
technology for the identification and analysis of plant 
transporters for sugars, amino acids and peptides. In yeast, 
an even broader variety of membrane transporters has been 
identified and characterized. Several mutants with uptake 
deficiencies are already available, and the collection of 
deletion strains of all yeast reading frames is scheduled for 
completion by the end of the year 1999 (EUROFAN). We will 
select putative transport mutants from this collection, and, 
as the identification of exporters and internal membrane 
transporters requires retargeting of proteins, will construct 
uptake mutants carrying multiple deletions by sequential 
homologous recombination. Biochemical specificities of 
respective proteins and physiological characteristics of 
mutant strains will be investigated, enabling us to establish 
appropriate selection conditions for functional 
complementation using 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> full length cDNA libraries in yeast expression vectors 
to identify novel transporters (e.g. for various solutes 
including ureides, nucleobases, inositol, ascorbate etc.).
<LI>Multiplex Expression Analysis
<br>Tailored cDNA arrays will be developed that contain a 
collection of membrane transport protein and control genes of 
which non-conserved cDNA fragments 200-400 bp in length will 
be amplified. With these cDNA arrays we will investigate the 
physiological plant response to environmental stress 
conditions and nutritional deficiencies at the level of 
transcriptional regulation of genes involved in transport 
processes. In establishing growth conditions we will closely 
adhere to standards that are being defined by international 
microarray initiatives and collaborate with the "Gauntlet" 
consortium within GABI. In addition, we will determine the 
global membrane protein gene expression levels in selected 
knock-out mutants.
<LI>Functional characterization by mutant analysis
<br>Phenotypical and physiological consequences of knock-out 
mutations will be investigated in detail, thereby allowing 
evaluation of potential agronomic applications in crop plant 
species. T-DNA and transposable element-induced large 
populations of insertion mutants made available by the 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> stock centers (
<A HREF=".uk/">
NASC
</A> and 
<A HREF="/abrc/">
ABRC
</A>) will be used to perform reverse genetics screenings for 
knock-out mutations of novel transporter genes.
<LI>Analysis of substrate specificity and transport activity
<br>To characterize substrate specificity and transport 
activity, putative membrane transporter genes will be 
expressed in 
<I>Xenopus
</I> oocytes. For the selected genes full-length cDNAs will 
be isolated and cloned into GFP-fusion expression vectors. 
The GFP-moiety will allow the non-destructive "on line" 
expression monitoring. Transport characteristics will be 
determined by measurement of membrane potential changes 
(TEVC).

<p>Transcription factors (TFs) contribute considerably to the

about 300 TFs will be studied in tight co-ordination between 
the partners: 200 by the group in Golm (

members of large TF gene families, over-expression lines will 
be generated and null-mutants will be isolated. The proposed 
TF function deduced from the phenotype of these plants will 
be verified or falsified through physiological, molecular, 
and/or morphological analysis of the overexpressing or 
null-mutant plants. The further aim of this project is the 
use of the created data to identify TF genes that modulate 
agronomical important characteristics of plants.

<p>This network aims to identify genes that play a crucial 
role in determining how the model plant 
<I>Arabidopsis thaliana
</I> responds to a wide range of abiotic and biotic factors, 
and analyse how they interact to determine fitness and 
productivity.
<OL TYPE=i>
<LI>A wide range of defined growth conditions ("gauntlets") 
will be established in which the response to different carbon 
balances, nutrient limitation, anaerobiosis, temperature, pH, 
salt, water and heavy metal stress, and biotic stress are 
clearly, reproducibly and controllably displayed.
<LI>High-throughput techniques will be exploited to analyse 
transcript-, protein/enzyme activity-, peptide-, 
oligosaccharide-, and metabolite-profiles. Emphasis will be 
placed on generation of validated results in defined 
conditions that are suitable for integration and exploration 
in a multi-dimensional data bank. Interpretation of 
transcript and metabolite profiles will be supported by a 
characterisation of the sources of variation in individual 
transcripts and metabolites in non-stressed material, and by 
investigation of developmental-, tissue- and cell-specific 
transcript, protein and metabolite profiles. Working against 
this growing background of information:
<LI>Genes, proteins, peptides and metabolites involved in 
sensing and/or responding to environmental challenges will be 
isolated using complementary approaches, including non-biased 
horizontal analysis of transcripts and metabolites, and 
mutant screening based on novel phenotypes or expression 
patterns. 
<LI>Groups of genes, proteins/enzyme activities and 
metabolites will be identified that are diagnostic for 
different states.
<LI>Transformants with altered expression of candidate genes 
will be subjected to systematic analysis to provide a 
detailed analysis of gene function.
</OL>
<p>The aim of this consortium is a systematic functional 
analysis that encompasses all the genes in the genome to be 
achieved by combining
<OL TYPE=i>
<LI>the unique genetic resources made available by the 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> genome project with 
<LI>what is termed "gauntlets" - high throughput test systems 
to detect changes in behaviour and fitness in response to 
various environmental challenges, and
<LI>emerging technologies that allow high throughput analyses 
of transcripts, proteins, peptides, oligosaccharides, and 
metabolites. The goal is a thorough analysis of a model 
system in multiple dimensions: genetic constitution 
(loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutants, ecotypes and 
ecotype combinations), conditions (various environmental 
factors), space (organs, tissues and cell types), and time 
(developmental status). 
</OL>
<p>This will provide the means to uncover important genetic 
diversity and identify novel candidate genes for use in 
breeding, to identify key gene programmes and key regulatory 
metabolites, and to identify transcript, proteins/enzyme 
activity and metabolite sets that can be employed as 
diagnostic kits for physiological states or genetic 
predispositions.The approach taken in this network integrates 
a wide range of approaches and contains novel and unique 
features:
</p>
<p>First, selection of the growth conditions and plant 
phenotype is given a high priority, because the need for 
correct choice of the experimental conditions is not relaxed 
when analytic techniques become more efficient: on the 
contrary, it becomes even more important because otherwise 
massive amounts of suspect or ill-defined data will 
accumulate and hold back progress. By interacting with 
specialists in bioinformatics, both locally and in 
<A HREF="http://mips.gsf.de/proj/gabi/">
GABI-Info
</A>, the participants will exploit their experience to set 
up robust and reliable central multi-dimensional data bank 
that includes guidelines for the design and validation of 
experiments whose results are to be submitted to the data 
bank.
</p>
<p>Second, the network unites groups with experience in, or 
with privileged access to, novel analytic techniques and 
developments: this includes not only arrays for 
multi-parallel transcript analysis, but also the powerful 
high throughput techniques for analysis of proteins 
oligosaccharides, peptides and metabolites, including a broad 
spectrum of secondary metabolites. A further important 
feature is the application of these techniques at the tissue 
and single cell level. This comprehensive analysis of 
responses at the levels of overall growth and visual 
phenotype, transcripts, protein/enzyme activities, and 
metabolites will allow a rigorous assessment of gene 
function. It will allow subtle but important phenotypes to be 
identified: an important capability because we already know 
that knock-out mutants often lack obvious phenotypes, 
implying that the functions of many genes will only become 
apparent after a more detailed analysis at a range of levels 
and in a range of conditions. It will allow us to generate a 
data bank that contains a rich collection of information at 
different levels of organisation, giving novel and exciting 
possibilities for multi-dimensional data mining.
</p>
<p>Third, the defined conditions, technical capacity and 
accumulation of knowledge will provide a unique opportunity 
to exploit undirected and directed genetic diversity 
generated in the other 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> network. They will allow efficient analysis and 
exploitation of the natural variation and novel mutations 
provided by network I, "Creation and detection of new genetic 
diversity". A close interaction will emerge with network II, 
"Protein Communities", especially during functional analysis 
of transformants with altered expression of membrane proteins 
and altered expression of transcription factors.

<p>As the result of a 10-year international effort, the first 
genome of a green plant, 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I>, was 
<A HREF="http://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/news/press/00/pr0094.htm">
completely sequenced
</A> by the end of 2000. In expectation of this event, the 
<A HREF="http://www.nsf.gov/">
National Science Foundation USA
</A> (NSF) sponsored a workshop at the Salk Institute 
(January 2000) to discuss goals of a 10 year follow-up 
project. As a consequence, an NSF program was initiated to 
determine the function of all 25,000 

<I>Arabidopsis
</I> genes "within their cellular, organismal and 
evolutionary context" by the year 2010 (<A 
HREF="/portals/masc/workshop2010.jsp">The 2010 project
</A>). The outline of the NSF project states very clearly 
that the "
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> research community has become a model of international 
research collaboration. It is expected that continued efforts 
by the international community of scientists will be 
essential for the success of the 2010 Project." This 
statement acknowledged that the successful completion of the 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> genome sequence was based on contributions by scientists 
not only from the USA, but also from many European countries 
and Japan. Among these, a particularly important German 
contribution were the gene annotation efforts by

<p>This international background and the enthusiasm about the 
new, revolutionary possibilities of plant research in a

group of plant biologists in Germany to elaborate a proposal 
for a 10-year German

<p>Functional analysis of multiprotein families was agreed 
upon as the central topic for initial 
grant applications to the 
<A HREF="http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/plantphys/AFGN/">
AFGN
</A>. This includes the analysis of all members of a given 
multi-protein family with respect to their expression and 
function during the 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> life cycle. From the very beginning, all essential 
aspects of the German initiative including the scientific 
aims, details of the organisation as well as essential 
aspects of the timing and tight international integration 
were discussed in the context of the 
<A HREF="/portals/masc/workshop2010.jsp">
NSF 2010 Project
</A>. One of the central tenets of this NSF project and one 
of the main reasons why 
<I>Arabidopsis

that any new tools and new knowledge derived during the 
project are made available to the community in a timely 
manner and without restrictions.

</p> 
<p>The second funding period of the AFGN will end in the fall of 2007.

cooperation within the framework of the AFGN.

<p><b>Future support will concentrate on two areas of research:</b>

<dl>
<I>Functional Genomics of Biological Processes</I><br>
Research in the AFGN has shown that different members of a given 
<I>Arabidopsis</I> multiprotein family may be multifunctional and, thus, 
may play a role in different biological processes and pathways. As a 
consequence, the focus of AFGN will move from a sole multiprotein 
family-based genomic approach towards the genomic analysis of multigene 
networks whose members functionally interact with each other in 
accomplishing a given biological process.<p>
<dl>

<I>Tools and Resources for Plant Functional Genomic Research</I><br>
There is still demand for the development of novel and genome-wide tools 
and technologies and additional resources in plant functional genomics 
to address unmet needs. It is expected that these methods and tools will 
complement the already existing tools and research resources, will 
provide quantitative readouts, will be cost effective and comprehensive, 
and, thus, will be readily adopted by the scientific community.<br>
