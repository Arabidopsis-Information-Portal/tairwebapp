 	<IMG SRC="/images/redball.gif"> <b>NAASC-organized workshop on Arabidopsis bioinformatics needs</b>: <p>
NAASC members Mark Estelle and Blake Meyers, assisted by the NAASC Coordinator, organized a May workshop to address solutions to long-term sustainability
of Arabidopsis bioinformatics resources. This workshop followed a MASC-organized workshop in the UK in April to assess the bioinformatics needs of the community.
<p>
<b>Outcomes</b>:<br>
<li> Results of discussions at the workshops were presented at the 2010 ICAR in Japan
<li> Ensuing reports will be posted on the MASC webpages at TAIR
<li> Workshop participants, led by US organizer Blake Meyers, developed a commentary to be published in The Plant Cell (August, 2010)
<li> Blake Meyers submitted an RCN proposal to the National Science Foundation that was awarded in June, 2011, to fund development of the International Arabidopsis Informatics Consortium which will draw
on the recommendations of the US and UK workshops to strengthen international collaborations and address current and future informatics needs of the plant biology communities.

</A> in fiscal year 2001.  The program's goal is to 
determine the function of 25,000 genes in

coordinated with similar activities world-wide, that the 
investigators post publicly the identity of genes under 
investigation, and that the outcome of the awards (data, 
information and materials) be made available to the 
public according to the timetable approved by NSF. Through fiscal year 2008,
<A HREF="http://www.nsf.gov/bio/pubs/awards/2010awards.htm">
149 awards
