<p>Australia has a strong tradition in plant scientific 
research. Many institutions, including the 
<A HREF="http://www.pi.csiro.au/">
Plant Industry Division
</A> of the 
<A HREF="http://www.csiro.au/">
Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research 
Organisation
</A> (CSIRO), the major Universities and private 
enterprise are engaged in 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> Functional Genomics work ranging from individual 
projects to international collaborations through to 
major resource development.  
<A HREF="http://www.pi.csiro.au/">
CSIRO's Division of Plant Industry
</A> funds major programs in Plant Genomics. Otherwise, 
funding is mainly available through the 
<A HREF="http://www.arc.gov.au/arc_home/default.htm">
Australian Research Council's
</A> (ARC's) Discovery and Linkage Grant Schemes, its <A HREF="http://www.arc.gov.au/grant_programs/centre_excellence.htm"> Center of Excellence Scheme</A>, and the 
<A HREF="http://www.grdc.com.au/">
Grains Research and Development Corporation of Australia
</A> (GRDC). In addition, many Australian-based 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> researchers receive funding from international 
Agbiotech companies or collaborate with overseas 
colleagues.
</p>

<p>Researchers in all Australian States and the Capital 
Territory now use 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> functional genomics approaches. Projects are 
generally highly focused, but increasingly involve 
international collaborators. A number of Australian cities are home institutes with substantial <I> Arabidopsis</I> research including   
<A HREF="http://www.biolsci.monash.edu.au"> Monash University </A>, <A HREF="http://www.unimelb.edu.au"> University of Melbourne </A>, <A HREF="http://www.anu.edu.au">The Australian National University</A>, <A HREF="http://www.uq.edu.au"> The University of Queensland </A> ,and  <A HREF="http://www.adelaide.edu.au/"> The University of Adelaide. </A>.</p>

<p>The 

<A HREF="http://www.acpfg.com.au/">
Australian Centre for Plant Functional Genomics
</A> is a major initiative announced in 2001. 
Established jointly by the 
<A HREF="http://www.arc.gov.au/">
ARC
</A> and the 
<A HREF="http://www.grdc.com.au/">
GRDC
</A>, the Centre's objective is to contribute to 
ensuring that Australia remains internationally 
competitive in plant science research. Its current focus, 
however, is on major crop plants, with little emphasis on 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I>.

include:
<br>

total funds allocated under the National Competitive 
Grants Scheme in the 2003 funding round.

<A NAME="newzealand">
New Zealand
</A>
</H4>
</p>

<p>New Zealand has a small population but is 
nevertheless home to several 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> research programs. Increasing numbers of New 
Zealand plant scientists are incorporating 
<I>Arabidopsis thaliana
</I> into their research, and at least six groups are 
using functional genomics approaches.  Funding is 
principally available through the 
<A HREF="http://www.rsnz.govt.nz/funding/marsden_fund/">
Royal Society of New Zealand's Marsden Fund
</A> and the 
<A HREF="http://www.frst.govt.nz/">
New Zealand Foundation for Research, Science and 
Technology
</A>). 
 Although neither program specifically supports overseas 
research collaborations, several New Zealand 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> researchers collaborate with overseas colleagues at 
institutions including the Scripps Research Institute 
(San Diego), The John Innes Centre (Norwich), CSIRO 
Plant Industry (Canberra) and Universities in Sweden and 
the UK. As expected for a country the size of New 
Zealand, there is not a lot of money in the research 
budget but those that are funded can support projects of 
reasonable size.
</p>

<p>Geographically, 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> research seems to be concentrated in three regions: 
in the North Island cities of Auckland and Palmerston 
North and at the University of Otago in Dunedin, on the 
South Island. In addition to the Universities, research 
programs are carried out at the Government-owned Crown 
Research Institutes, including 
<A HREF="http://www.hortresearch.co.nz/">
Horticulture and Food Research Institute of New Zealand 
(HortResearch)
</A> and 
<A HREF="http://www.crop.cri.nz/">
New Zealand Institute for Crop & Food Research Limited
</A> (Crop & Food Research).  The 
<A HREF="http://www.hortresearch.co.nz/products/nzcel/">
New Zealand Controlled Environment Facility
</A> at 
<A HREF="http://www.hortresearch.co.nz/">
HortResearch
</A> in Palmerston North is keen to provide PC2 growth 
rooms for 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> researchers. The facility has the capacity to 
simulate most environmental extremes and may be of value 
to researchers investigating gene expression under 
varying conditions. Government regulations for carrying 
out genetic transformation work are extremely rigorous 
in New Zealand and many research scientists have 
recently expressed concern about how this will impact on 
New Zealand's ability to compete in an international 
market.
</p>

<p>The horticultural industry is a big part of the New 
Zealand economy and, reflecting this, much of the 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> research impinges on reproductive development and 
fruiting.
