The super-family of subtilisin-like serine proteases 
(subtilases) is comprised of prokaryotic and eukaryotic 
members. They can broadly be separated into two classes: 
degenerative subtilases identified mainly in prokaryotes 
(prototype: subtilisin BPN from 
<I>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens
</I>) and processing proteases from eukaryotes. The 
'prototype'  of the latter is KEX2 from 
<I>Saccharomyces cerevisiae
</I> which activates through cleavage the pro-mating type 
factor. Human processing proteases such as Furin/PACE or 
PC1/PC3 activate pro-hormones or pro-receptors. A number of 
plant subtilases have been isolated belonging to the 
pyrolysin subfamily which also includes processing proteases. 
Only very limited information is hitherto available on the 
action of plant subtilases, which nevertheless points to a 
high importance of these proteases in plant defense responses 
or control of developmental processes. 
<I>Arabidopsis thaliana
</I> contains about 50 different subtilase genes. To gain 
insight into their roles a plant subtilase database (PSDB) 
will be set up and sequence analysis performed to define 
specific subfamilies; expression analysis of the subtilase 
genes will be carried out by means of microarrays (or other 
multi-parallel techniques), promoter-GUS / protein-GFP 
fusions, mRNA 
<I>in situ
</I> hybridisation, immuno-localisation; mutants will be 
identified in insertion mutant collections or via TILLING and 
by antisense / RNAi and (inducible) overexpression; mutants 
will be analysed for morphological characteristics and by 
mRNA, protein/peptide, and metabolite profiling; heterologous 
expression of the subtilases (in insect cells) will be 
performed to evaluate enzyme activities and substrate 
specificities.  Future approaches (including the isolation of 
further mutants) will be directed towards the identification 
of the substrates, and the analysis of their functions in the 
signal transduction pathways they possibly trigger.

<BLOCKQUOTE> 
Due to their chemical reactivity, many aldehydes are toxic 
for organisms at low concentrations. It is therefore 
important that metabolic aldehyde levels are strictly 
controlled. Many biologically important aldehydes are 
metabolized by the superfamily of NAD(P)
<sup>+
</sup>-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenases [aldehyde:NAD(P)
<sup>+
</sup> oxidoreduc-tases, EC 1.2.1]. A recent survey of 145 
aldehyde dehydrogenase sequences from various organisms 
revealed that they cluster into two main phylogenetic trunks 
with at least 13 subfamilies which mainly exhibit four 
different enzymatic functions: detoxification, intermediary 
metabolism, osmotic protection and NADPH generation (Perozich 
et al., 1999). Many of the subfamilies are substrate specific 
enzymes as the non-phosphorylating glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate 
dehydrogenases (GAPDH, EC 1.2.1.9), methylmalonate 
semialdehyde dehydrogenases (MMSALDH, EC 1.2.1.27), succinic 
semialdehyde dehydrogenases (SSALDH, EC 1.2.1.16) or betaine 
aldehyde dehydrogenases (BADH, EC 1.2.1.8), whereas the 
variable substrate aldehyde dehydrogenases (class-1/2 and 
class-3 ALDHs) catalyze the oxidation of a broad spectrum of 
aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes to their corresponding 
carboxylic acids and are either NAD-dependent (EC 1.2.1.3) or 
NADP-linked (EC 1.2.1.5).
<br>  Plants possess a variety of distinct ALDHs, but 
information on their biological role is limited. In a study 
to identify genes that play an important role during the 
ABA-dependent dehydration stress response, we recently 
isolated genes with significant homologies and functional 
characteristics of mammalian class 3 ALDHs and constitute a 
novel class of plant ALDHs (Kirch et al., 2001).
<br>The aldehyde dehydrogenase gene family in 
<i>Arabidopsis thaliana
</i> consists of 14 genes and can be divided into at least 
nine subfamilies based on protein sequence conservation and 
phylogenetic analysis. The aim of this research project is to 
determine the biological function of the 
<i>ALDH
</i> gene family from 
<i>A. thaliana 
</i>  focusing on members of the class-3 
<i>ALDH
</i>, 
<i>BADH
</i> and turgor-responsive  
<i>ALDH
</i> genes, because of their potential role in osmotic stress 
adaptation.
<br>The following experimental approaches will be pursued:
<br>  Knock-Out mutations for the identified 
<i>ALDH
</i> genes will be isolated to study their effects on 
physiological and morphological characteristics. In addition, 
transgenic plants with a modified 
<i>ALDH
</i> gene expression will be constructed. 
<i>ALDH
</i> expression will be analyzed in wild-type, mutant and 
transgenic plants under defined physiological conditions. 
Recombinant proteins will be used to determine enzymatic 
properties of the ALDHs. To identify putative 
<i>in vivo
</i> substrates, metabolite profiling of wild-type, mutant 
and transgenic plants and a substrate trapping strategy will 
be used in the future.

The metal chelator nicotianamine represents one transport 
mechanism for iron and can itself presumably be relocated via 
membrane-bound YELLOWSTRIPE-LIKE (YSL) proteins. The lack of 
nicotianamine or its transporter causes leaf chlorosis in 
tomato and maize, respectively. The precise role of 
nicotianamine for transport and sequestering of iron and as 
possible signal for the regulation of iron uptake is not 
understood. Our long-term goal is to unravel the function of 
nicotianamine within the network of iron uptake components. 
We aim at determining the role of the different members of 
the gene families for metabolism and transport of 
nicotianamine at a molecular, biochemical and genetic level 
with special emphasis on regulatory aspects (4 nicotianamine 
synthase nas genes, 2 nicotianamine aminotransferase naat-
like genes, 8 ysl genes, in collaboration with Prof. E. 
Walker, Amherst, USA). One of the most important tools to be 
identified from this project is a nicotianamine-free 
Arabidopsis mutant that will be analysed in a combinatorial 
approach with ysl and further iron uptake mutants.

DNA helicase-like proteins are involved in the unwinding of 
DNA strands and chromatin structure. In yeast all three 
radiation-induced DNA repair pathways contain a member of an 
interrelated DNA helicase-like gene family, namely 
<I>RAD5
</I> (post-replicative repair), 
<I>RAD16
</I> (excision repair) and 
<I>RAD54
</I> (recombination repair). In Arabidopsis a large multigene 
family (MGF) exists in which ten members (At1g02670; 
At1g05120; At1g11100; At1g50410; At1g611140; At3g16600; 
At3g20010; At5g05130; At5g22750; At5g43530) can be especially 
grouped as being highly homologous to both <I>RAD5
</I> and 
<I>RAD16
</I>, although a clear assignment to one or the other gene is 
not possible for all members. Besides biochemical 
characterization of the members of this AtRAD5/RAD16 MGF 
<i>in vitro 
</i>, a matrix of interactions should be established by two-
hybrid analysis with putative interaction partners known from 
yeast that are also present as MGFs in Arabidopsis. T-DNA 
insertion mutants of the AtRAD5/RAD16 MGF have already been 
identified and will be tested on sensitivity against DNA 
damaging agents and in their ability to repair UV-specific 
DNA damage. By using transgenic reporter constructs 
<i>in planta, 
</i> differences in repair and recombination will be 
elucidated as well as the role of the respective genes in 
response to genotoxic stress by array based expression 
profiling.

Purines and pyrimidines play a key role in nucleic acid 
and nucleotide metabolism of all cells. In addition, they can 
be used as nitrogen sources in many micro-organisms and 
plants e.g. for the biosynthesis of secondary compounds such 
as cytokinins or some alkaloids. In nodules of legumes, the 
degradation of purines which are synthesized in the plastids 
leads to the accumulation of ureides (allantoin and allantoic 
acid) that are used for translocation and storage of 
nitrogen. Nucleobase biogenesis and catabolism require 
therefore an extensive intracellular and intercellular 
transport of nucleobase metabolites, mediated by specific 
trans-membrane transport proteins. Nucleobase transporters 
have been identified genetically and/or by biochemical means 
in bacteria, fungi, protozoa, algae, plants and mammals. A 
limited number of bacterial and fungal transporter genes have 
been cloned and analysed in greater detail at the molecular 
level. Nucleobase transporters can be grouped into three 
families: the Nucleobase-Ascorbate Transporters (NATs), the 
Purine Related Transporters (PRTs) that are found only in 
prokaryotes and fungi, and the plant Purine Related 
Transporters (purine permeases, PUPs). The 
<I>Arabidopsis thaliana
</I> genome contains at least 12 distributed genes encoding 
putative NAT proteins with yet unknown functions. The aim of 
this project is to elucidate the physiological roles and 
transport specificities of the various members of the NAT 
protein family in organelles and the plasma membrane. The 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> NAT proteins will be heterologously expressed in yeast 
cells and the ascomycete 
<I>Aspergillus nidulans
</I> and characterized by complementation and uptake studies.
<br>Using Northern blot assays, cDNA microarrays, by 
(sub)cellular localization studies, and by isolation and 
characterization of insertion mutants at the molecular, 
biochemical and physiological levels the 
<I>in planta
</I> function of these transporters will be elucidated.

The two-component system, consisting of a histidine protein 
kinase that senses a signal input and a response regulator 
that mediates the output, is an ancient and evolutionary 
conserved signaling mechanism in prokaryotes and some 
eukaryotes. The identification of several histidine kinases, 
histidine-containing phosphotransfer proteins and response 
regulators in 
<i>  Arabidopsis
</i> and other plant species suggests an important role of 
two-component phosphorelay in plant signal transduction as 
well.
<br> This project aims to explore the role of the two-
component signaling network in 
<i>  Arabidopsis
</i> plant growth and development. By a combinatorial use of 
genetic, molecular, cell biological, biochemical and 
physiological methods and techniques we will characterize the 
function of two-component elements and identify the signaling 
pathways, to which these elements participate. Furthermore, 
our approach will reveal, how the two-component network of 
<i>  Arabidopsis
</i> is weaved and linked to other eukaryotic signal 
transduction cascades.

The SBP-domain represents a novel DNA-binding domain 
shared by a family of putative transcription factors only 
found in plants.In 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I>, SBP-domain proteins are encoded by a structural 
heterogeneous gene family comprising 16 members known as SPL 
(SBP-Like) genes. These SPL genes show high similarity within 
the conserved SBP-box but limited sequence conservation 
outside this box. Furthermore, their temporal and spatial 
expression patterns suggest roles in different developmental 
pathways. However, these roles remain largely unknown.Aim of 
this project is to obtain information concerning the roles 
SBP-box proteins may play in 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> development. Transposon mutagenized 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> populations will be screened for spl mutant alleles and 
transgenic knockout lines will be generated. To allow their 
integration in regulatory networks, we will screen for 
interacting proteins as well as for possible target genes.

Plants and humans require adequate amounts of 
micronutrients like iron and zinc, but accumulation of an 
excess or uptake of chemically related non-essential metals 
like cadmium or lead can be extremely harmful. Proteins of 
the CDF (cation diffusion facilitator) family are involved in 
the homeostasis Cd2+, Co2+, Fe2+ and Zn2+ in bacteria, 
yeasts, animals and plants. Our aim is to elucidate the role 
of CDF proteins in 
<I>Arabidopsis thaliana
</I>. Complementary DNAs are to be functionally expressed in 
appropriate mutants of 
<I>Saccharomyces cerevisiae
</I> to test their function. In a reverse genetics approach 
several representative 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> CDFs will be selected for the identification of knockout 
mutants and/or the use of RNA interference technology. 
Regulation and localization of these CDFs will be 
investigated by expressing promoter:GUS fusions and epitope-
tagged fusion proteins in 
<I>A. thaliana
</I>, and by development and use of specific antibodies. 
Little is known about protein-protein interactions of 
membrane proteins. Such interactions might be vital for CDF 
function because their substrate metal cations are thought to 
be bound to metallochaperone proteins in the cytoplasm. 
Selected CDF family members or fragments thereof will be used 
as a bait in both classical yeast two-hybrid and yeast 
split-ubiquitin screens the latter expected to be more 
appropriate for membrane proteins.

Ubiquitin-mediated degradation of proteins by the 26S 
proteasome plays an important role in signaling cascades of 
many cellular processes in all eukaryotes regulating 
transcription, DNA replication, cell cycle, differentiation 
and responses to various exogenous stimuli. The specificity 
of the ubiquitylation is mediated by different classes of 
ubiquitin ligases. SCF complexes (for Skp1/Cullin/F-box 
protein) form one of the most important classes of ubiquitin 
ligases in eukaryotes, whereby the F-box proteins mediate the 
specific recognition of target proteins. Because about 2.5 % 
of all identified 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> genes encode for putative components of SCF complexes, 
this class of ubiquitin ligases probably plays an outstanding 
role in regulating specific protein degradation in higher 
plants. In the proposed research projects, we want to analyze 
the function, composition and targets of SCF complexes which 
carry a certain subfamily of F-box proteins. These F-box 
proteins show homology to EID1, an important component of 
phytochrome A-dependent light signaling that was identified 
from our group. Furthermore, we want to elucidate the 
specificity of the interaction between the highly variable F-
box domains and the components of the core complexes.

Calcium signals regulate a multitude of biological 
responses and cellular processes in eukaryotic organisms. 
Although considerable progress has been made in elucidating 
physiological processes involving calcium signals in plants, 
the identity of most of the components involved and the 
mechanisms generating specificity in these signaling 
cascades are only beginning to be understood. This project 
aims to comprehensively explore the mechanisms of a novel 
calcium signaling system from 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I>. Based on the recent identification of a specific group 
of serine-threonine protein kinases (AtCIPKs) as interacting 
targets of the 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> calcineurin B-like calcium sensor proteins (AtCBLs) this 
project is focused on the functional characterisation of the 
CBL-CIPK protein-protein interaction network and its 
contribution to integrate and specifically decode the various 
calcium signals in plant cells. The proposed research 
addresses the following main objectives:
<OL TYPE=1>
<LI>A thorough molecular characterisation of the CBL and CIPK 
protein families by analysing their expression, subcelluar 
localisation, biochemical properties and interaction 
specificity.
<LI>The identification of the specific physiological 
processes regulated by the differential calcium sensor/kinase 
complex formation. This approach will rely on the isolation 
and detailed phenotypical, physiological and genetic 
characterisation of mutant lines generated by reverse genetic 
approaches as well as on interaction analyses by yeast two-
hybrid assays. 
<LI>The identification and analysis of proteins regulated by 
the CBL-CIPK complexes by means of large scale two- and 
three-hybrid screens.

Chloroplast localization is predicted or has been found for 
around 100 protein kinases (cpPKs) in

<br>
It is of vital importance for every organism to tightly regulate the activity 
of its genes temporally and/or spatially in response to various external and 
internal stimuli. The specific expression of each gene results from specific 
cis-regulatory elements in non-coding regions, especially the 5' upstream region. 
Our projects will detect new candidates of cis-regulatory elements in plant 
genomes by combining several approaches (phylogenetic footprinting, enumerative 
methods). These motifs will be evaluated by statistical validation and by comparing 
our results to known cis-regulatory sites in plants.

In maize, the  
<i>indeterminate 
</i> gene plays a role in the regulation and/or translocation 
to the shoot apical meristem of leaf-derived signals that are 
required for the transition to flowering. It encodes a zinc 
finger protein that contains a C2H2 motif and a second zinc 
finger with a CCHC signature. We isolated two  
<i>Arabidopsis 
</i> cDNAs that encode proteins showing very high degrees of 
identity to the maize ID1 protein. They belong to a family of 
12 very closely related proteins designated INDETERMINATE1-
like (IDL) proteins, all of which are uncharacterised to 
date. The  
<i>Arabidopsis 
</i> proteins IDL1 and IDL2 interact with the nuclear export 
receptor Exportin&nbsp;1 (XPO1), contain an NLS and a nuclear 
export signal (NES) and therefore are shuttling proteins. 
<br> We are investigating the function of specific  
<i>IDL 
</i> genes in  
<i>Arabidopsis 
</i> using T-DNA insertion lines and RNAi approaches, which 
will be used for phenotypic analyses, complementation 
studies, and genetic experiments. Transgenic plants that 
carry transcriptional or translational fusions with reporter 
genes under control of the endogenous promoter are used to 
elucidate the temporal and spatial mRNA expression  
<i>in planta 
</i>. Like with 
<i>ID1
</i> in maize, 
<i>Arabidopsis 
</i> 
<i>IDL1
</i> and
<i>IDL2 
</i> are expressed predominantly in leaves. Of special 
interest for us is the nucleo-cytoplasmic partitioning of IDL 
proteins during different stages of development. This will be 
analysed 
<i> in planta 
</i> using EYFP fusion proteins driven by the endogenous 
promoter. We mapped the NLS and the NES in IDL1/IDL2 and thus 
are able to analyse the effects of nucleo-cytoplasmic 
partitioning on signalling  
<i>in planta 
</i> by expressing point-mutated versions of these proteins 
that either show no nuclear import or no nuclear export. We 
are also interested in identifying interacting proteins and 
DNA-binding domains for IDL proteins.

Nucleoside transport across human, animal, fungi and 
bacterial cell membranes has been intensively characterised 
in the past at the physiological and molecular level. The 
corresponding transport proteins mediating nucleoside 
transport are classified into two groups: one group catalyses 
facilitated diffusion along a concentration gradient (ENT, 
equilibrative nucleoside transporters), whereas the members 
of the other group (CNT, concentrative nucleoside 
transporters,) are able to transport nucleosides against an 
existing concentration gradient. Thus, the activity of the 
latter requires metabolic energy and up to now both, sodium 
or proton coupled nucleoside transport catalysed by CNT type 
carriers have been identified.  
<br>The function of nucleoside import into animal cells is 
mainly to allow nucleotide syn-thesis via salvage pathways in 
cells lacking the capacity for de novo synthesis. Moreover, 
adenosine functions as an extra-cellular messenger molecule, 
and is known to cause cell toxicity and immunosuppression, to 
influence cell morphology, to act as a vasodilator, and to 
stimulate hormone secretion. Therefore, transport of these 
com-pounds plays an important role in regulation of cellular 
signalling, regulation of metabolism and development. 
<br>In contrast, our knowledge about the function of 
nucleosides in plant cells and tissues is much more limited. 
In general, plant cells harbour enzymes allowing nucleoside 
salvage and some of the genes coding for these enzymes have 
been identified at the molecular level. In plants, nucleoside 
uptake into the phloem tissue has been detected. The phloem 
represents a tubular system, consisting of living cells, 
which allows long distance transport of organic products 
between plant organs. These products are either generated by 
photosynthesis, or liberated by degradation of various 
storage products. Cotyledons prepared from developing castor-
bean seedlings import nucleosides, which have previously been 
liberated from mobilising endosperm tissue. In addition, 
intact petunia pollen cells are able to import exogenous 
nucleosides via both, an active import and a facilitated 
diffusion. 
<br>Recently we identified the first plant nucleoside 
transporter ENT1 from  
<i>Arabidopsis thaliana 
</i> on the molecular level. The family of nucleoside 
transporters in  
<i>Arabidopsis 
</i> comprises of eight members in total. They all share the 
same structure with equilibrative nucleoside transporters 
from human, animals, fungi and bacteria. Interestingly ENT1 
from  
<i>Arabidopsis 
</i> functions as a concentrative nucleoside transporter, 
performing a proton nucleoside cotransport. Our aim is to 
determine the biochemical properties of all eight putative 
nucleoside transporters and to analyse the corresponding 
physiological functions. To do this the cDNA's will be cloned 
and expressed in heterologous systems (e.g. bakers yeast or 
xenopus oocytes) to determine the transport characteristics. 
Using GFP fusion proteins, which will be transiently 
expressed in protoplasts, we want to analyse the localisation 
of ENT isoforms within the cell. The activity of the various 
ENT promoters in different tissues, and during plant 
development will be analysed by generating transgenic plants 
with promoter-GUS fusions. Finally, the availability of knock 
out plants for ENT transporters for the first time provides 
insight in corresponding changes in phenotypes, development, 
and differentially expressed proteins.

The complexity of the plant stress response systems

stress transcription factors (Hsfs). The project aims at the 
comparative analysis of these Hsfs with respect to their 
expression patterns, activator functions, intracellular 
localization and above all their interaction with other Hsfs 
(heterooligomerization) or other regulatory proteins 
(coregulators). A central aspect will be the characterization 
of the complex promoter architecture of the 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> hs genes and the role of Hsf combinations for efficient 
activation of these genes (synergism between Hsfs). The 
results from the first three years period will serve as a 
basis for more advanced investigations of the Hsf network and 
its cross talks with the general stress signalling pathways 
of plants.

To cope with the constant threat of infection by 
phytopathogenic micro-organisms plants have evolved 
sophisticated detection and response systems facilitating 
recognition of pathogen-derived signals and induction of 
appropriate defences. To broaden our understanding of signal 
perception complexes implicated in the activation of plant 
defense responses we propose the following experimental 
strategy:
<br>There are a total of 340 receptor protein kinases 
(receptor-like kinases, RLKs, including LRR transmembrane 
kinases) in 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I>, with only very little of these assigned a role in 
pathogen defense activation. We will assay RLK expression by 
Rt-PCR upon treatment of 
<I>Arabidopsis thaliana
</I> Col-0 plants with avirulent races from diverse 
phytopathogenic oomycetes and fungi (i.e. 
<I>Peronospora parasitica
</I>, 
<I>Phytophthora parasitica
</I>, 
<I>Fusarium oxysporum
</I>), but also with non-pathogenic oomycetes and fungi for 
which 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> is considered not a host plant. In addition, elicitors 
of plant defense reactions in 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> (
<I>Pseudomonas syringae
</I>-derived harpin, necrosis-inducing proteins from diverse 
<I>Phytophthora
</I> species, our unpublished work) will be tested. Selected 
RLK's will be characterized with respect to their functional 
involvement in plant defense signaling (screening of T-DNA 
insertion lines, RNA interference-based gene silencing). 
Biochemical characterization will involve isolation of 
interacting proteins (co-immunoprecipitation assays with 
tagged protein and subsequent identification of complexed 
proteins by proteolytic fragmentation and MALDI-TOF 
spectroscopy). In addition, yeast two-hybrid-based or 
split-ubiquitin-based cloning of proteins interacting with 
cytoplasmic (soluble) parts of RLK's will be performed.

Sulfurtransferases/rhodaneses (STs) are a group of enzymes 
widely distributed in plants, animals, and bacteria that 
catalyse the transfer of a sulfur atom from suitable sulfur 
donors to nucleophilic sulfur acceptors. The best 
characterized ST is bovine rhodanese which catalyses 
<i>in vitro
</i> the transfer of sulfane sulfur from thiosulfate to 
cyanide, leading to the formation of sulfite and thiocyanate. 
However, 
<i>in vivo
</i> neither substrates nor sulfur acceptors could be clearly 
identified in any of the organisms investigated. From 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i> two very similar STs were isolated and characterized so 
far; these STs consist of two domains (N- and C-terminal) of 
nearly identical size connected by a short linker sequence, 
similar to the structure of the bovine rhodanese. By using 
different strategies to mine the databases 18 ST-like 
proteins containing typical rhodanese domains or signatures 
could be identified in 
<i>  Arabidopsis
</i>. Despite the presence of ST/rhodanese activities in many 
living organisms, the physiological role of the members of 
this multi protein family (MPF) has not been established 
unambiguously. The aims of this project are the isolation and 
characterization of all members of the ST/rhodanese protein 
family in 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i>, the identification of their 
<i>in vivo
</i> substrates and acceptors, and the determination of the 
respective reaction mechanisms. Finally, the function of each 
single member of this MPF in the plant organisms is going to 
be elucidated.

It is well established that plant cells must repeatedly
assess and communicate their relative positions in order to 
allow proper development to occur. Little is known, however, 
about the underlying mechanisms of cell-cell communication. 
This project provides the basis for a long-term exploration 
of novel receptor kinase-dependent signal transduction 
pathways in 
<I>Arabidopsis thaliana
</I>. It will thus also enhance our knowledge on receptor-
mediated signal transduction in plants in general. The grant 
proposal is based on results from our previous analysis of 
<I>STRUBBELIG
</I> (
<I>SUB
</I>), a gene encoding a novel type of leucine-rich repeat 
receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK). Genetic analysis indicated 
that 
<I>SUB
</I> is required for apical meristem development, apical 
meristem size, floral organ initiation and outgrowth, and 
integument morphogenesis. Thus, 
<I>SUB
</I> defines a novel receptor kinase-based signal 
transduction pathway of general importance for organogenesis. 
<I>SUB
</I> and eight homologs of unknown function belong to the 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> LRR-V family of LRR-RLKs. The proposed research will be 
based on methods of reverse genetics, cellular and molecular 
biology, and biochemistry. The major focus will reside on the 
molecular characterization and the investigation of the 
biological function of the eight 
<I>SUB
</I> homologs of the family. Experiments are also planned 
that address the intracellular localization of the proteins 
and their potential interactions.

<I>Arabidopsis
</I> (At1g47056, At3g50080, At4g07400, At5g67250) with the 
primary goal of identifying their substrate spectra and the 
molecular determinants of their substrate specificity. 
Furthermore, we employ a gene trap approach to randomly tag 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> proteins with the luciferase reporter. The stability of 
these luciferase-tagged proteins after exposure to various 
stimuli will be investigated.

In 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I>, the MADS-box family of transcription factors comprises 
more than 100 members. The best known and most intensively 
studied are the floral homeotic MADS-box genes 
<I>AGAMOUS
</I> (
<I>AG
</I>), 
<I>APETALA3
</I> (
<I>AP3
</I>), 
<I>PISTILATA
</I> (
<I>PI
</I>) and 
<I>APETALA1
</I> (
<I>AP1
</I>), which control development and the establishment of 
organ identity of the four floral organs. The importance of 
these MADS proteins for floral organogenesis is manifested in 
the dramatic phenotypic alterations of organs, when the 
respective genes are inactivated by mutations. Other members 
of this protein family are involved in initiation of 
flowering, root development and tissue differentiation. The 
MADS proteins consist of four functional domains: the 
N-terminal MADS-box, the I-region, the K-box, and the 
C-terminus. The basic structure of the MADS proteins allows, 
besides their binding to DNA, to undergo multiple 
protein-protein interactions that seem to be the molecular 
basis of complex regulatory networks. So far, only little is 
known about MADS-box genes acting downstream of the organ 
identity genes during floral reproductive development in 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> and the majority of the 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> MADS-box genes is not yet characterized, neither 
structurally nor functionally.The goal of our project is to 
identify and analyse the function of 'novel' 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> MADS-box genes by 
<I>in silico
</I> identification/isolation of new MADS-box genes, 
expression pattern studies (RT-PCR, 
<I>in situ
</I> hybridisation), isolation of knock-out mutants of 
interesting MADS-box genes selected on the basis of their 
expression patterns, application of yeast-based techniques to 
isolate interaction partners, performance of 'ternary factor 
trap' screens, and the isolation of target genes of selected 
MADS proteins, in order to understand how the regulatory 
potential of these factors is realised during development.

WRKY proteins are a new family of zinc-finger type 
transcription factors found exclusively in plants. These 
proteins were shown to bind specifically to W Box-type 
[(C/T)TGAC(C/T)] DNA sequence elements both in vitro and in 
vivo. In 
<I>Arabidopsis thaliana
</I>, this large gene family consists of 74 members. The 
plant-specific existence of this super-family suggests that 
WRKY factors are involved in several unique processes 
required for plant developments and/or for the integration of 
environmental cues. Although still poorly studied, WRKY 
proteins appear to play an important regulatory role under 
stress-related conditions particularly during defense against 
phytopathogenic microbes. Aim of this project is to use 
defined 
<I>Arabidopsis
</I> WRKY "knock-out" and WRKY overexpressor lines for 
comparative protein profiling studies with wild-type plants 
under several defined stress-related conditions including 
senescence. Peptides differentially appearing in such 
profiles will be identified by MALDI-MS/MALDI-TOF. In 
addition, we plan to identify WRKY interacting partners with 
the help of epitope-tagged WRKY proteins.

Nucleotides have essential functions in a multitude of 
biochemical and developmental processes during the life cycle 
of a plant. As components of nucleic acids, phytohormones, 
cofactors, and energy rich precursors for carbohydrate 
metabolism (e.g. UDP-glucose) nucleotides are involved in 
essential processes in cellular function and plant growth. In 
plants, the pyrimidines UTP, UDP, UMP and the various UDP 
nucleotides play an essential role in sucrose metabolism and 
cell wall synthesis.
<br>Whereas nearly all enzymes in the pathway for 
<i>de novo
</i> synthesis are encoded by single genes, steps involved in 
salvage and in energy transfer between the pyrimidine and 
purine nucleotide system are encoded by multigene families in 
<i>Arabidopsis
</i>.
<br>This project focuses on the roles of two families:
<br>(a) Analysis of the uracil and purine 
phosphoribosyltransferase gene families and their 
contribution to overall plant nucleotide supply. Using state-
of-the-art molecular and biochemical technologies we will 
show whether there are developmental and spatial differences 
between the contribution of 
<i>de novo
</i> nucleotide synthesis and salvage recycling pathways 
under different growth conditions.
<br>(b) Analysis of the gene families coding for nucleoside 
mono- and diphosphate kinases which facilitate energy 
phosphotransfer between purine and pyrimidine nucleotides.
