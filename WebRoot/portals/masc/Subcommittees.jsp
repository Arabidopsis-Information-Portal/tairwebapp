<span class="mainheader">MASC Subcommittees</span>

<p>
<dt>
MASC subcommittees, proposed at the 13th International Conference on Arabidopsis Research (ICAR) held in Seville, Spain in 2002, were 
established to help track progress towards the goals outlined in the <A HREF="http://www.nsf.gov/pubsys/ods/getpub.cfm?bio0202">2002 Multinational 
Coordinated <I>Arabidopsis thaliana </I>Functional Genomics Project planning document</A>.
 <p>
Over time, changes in needs and priorities of the research community require reassesment of each subcommitee and changes are made if deemed necessary.
  A major revision of the MASC subcommitte structure was initated at the 16th ICAR (Madison, WI, 2005): two new subcommittees were proposed, two 
  were dissolved, and the need for two that were proposed at the 15th ICAR (Berlin, 2004) was re-emphasized.<br>
<br>  Newly proposed groups include the Phenomics Subcommittee and the Natural Variation/Comparative Genomics Subcommittee.The Multiparallel Tools 
and Forward/Reverse Genetic Stocks subcommittees were dissolved, and the Proteomics and Metabolomics subcommittees proposed in 2004 were given new 
emphasis to form.
<p>
In 2006 the newest subcommittee, Systems Biology, was proposed by Philip Benfey of Duke University.

<p>Representatives to each of the subcommittees are encouraged to be in frequent contact with Arabidopsis colleagues in their country or 
region who are contributing to research in their field.  In turn, each member of the Arabidopsis community is encouraged to be in contact 
with their MASC representative or subcommittee representative to communicate where his or her research fits into our community efforts and where 
he or she sees needs or new opportunities.

<p>
The cDNAs and Clone-based proteomics (ORFeomics) subcommittee is meant to include efforts aimed at the identification of expressed genes and proteins present in the plant.<br>
 This subcommittee tracks clone-based resources for the Arabidopsis community.  It is critical that materials from the community are made easily available from localized stock centers such as the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Center (UK) and the Arabidopsis Biological Stock Center (US). This prevents duplication of efforts and promotes the use of well-documented reference materials across multiple experiments conducted by independent laboratories. <br> Any functional genomics projects generating clone resources should be encouraged by funding bodies to donate their materials for public release or to include long-term dissemination plans in their activity.

A continuous goal and monitoring operation will be to ensure full integration of Arabidopsis-based 

Metabolomics reserach with the Metabolomics Standards Initiative that is currently being coordinated by the <a 

href="http://www.metabolomicssociety.org">Metabolomics Society.</a>  In this initiative, five working groups 

have already been formed and documents are being finalized covering (a) Biological Sample Context; (b) Chemical 

Analysis; (c) Data Analysis; (d) Ontology; and (e) Data Exchange.
<br>
Several members of the MASC Metabolomics subcommittee are involved in drawing up the plant biology specific 

documentation for the Metabolomics society. In addition this committee will aim to establish a mechanism that 

allows the dissemination of metabolomics datasets to the wider Arabidopsis community and encourage and 

facilitate initiatives for the integration of metabolomic datasets with other .omic datasets. This will involve 

depositing Metabolomic data in a usable format for data integration.

</p>
<p>
The subcommittee on Natural Variation and Comparative Genomics includes two working groups.

The <B>Natural Variation Working Group</B> has been established to identify technological and resource issues 

which are needed for progress in analysis of Arabidopsis natural variation.  In addition, conceptual 

opportunities for improved understanding of fundamental processes in plant biology will be considered.  

The <B>Comparative Genomics Working Group</B> has been established to consider priorities for future research 

in Arabidopsis Comparative Genomics in order to identify conceptual and technical goals as well as 

recommend species which will optimize progress towards these research goals. 

Finally, this subcommittee also inherits responsibilities of the former subcommittee on Genetic Resources which 

dealt with forward and reverse genetics, natural variation, and comparative genomics.  Although much progress 

has been made by the International Arabidopsis 2010 Initiative on many of these issues, further 

consultation regarding possible future needs is ongoing. </p>

Proteomics using <I>Arabidopsis thaliana</I> as a model system has made great progress in recent years. The 

throughput and accuracy of protein identification techniques such as shotgun proteomics based on liquid 

chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC/MS) or two-dimensional gel-electrophoresis (2DE) relies 

strongly on the availability of whole genome sequences. In light of the enormous complexity of a dynamic 

proteome, sample throughput presents a bottleneck for future research. The availability of both a complete 

genome sequence and high quality genome annotation makes <I>Arabidopsis thaliana</I> an ideal system to develop 

new technologies and identify candidate genes. Furthermore, Arabidopsis proteomics research will give 

direction to future plant proteomics developments and can serve as a unique database resource, especially when 

coordinated with the metabolomics and bioinformatics initiatives. It is an opportune moment to establish a 

working group devoted to Arabidopsis proteomics, and combine the efforts of different research groups to 

develop programs which will consolidate databases, technique standards and experimentally validated candidate 

genes and functions.

<p>
A primary goal of the subcommittee is to further the use of Systems Biology among Arabidopsis researchers to elucidate
the structure, dynamics, and organizational principles of the regulatory and metabolic networks that support living cells.
Although there is no widely agreed upon definition of Systems Biology, most work in this field can be characterized as
an effort to identify the molecular interactions that underlie cellular function and to integrate them in a coherent model. <br> Systems Biology uses high-dimensional data that are usually acquired through high-throughput approaches such as microarrays,
together with more focused high-resolution and high-content data, particularly time series. The elements within the large
datasets are seen as a parts list and an initial goal is to find the connections among the parts. This leads to the identification
of modules that frequently have properties that would be difficult to predict from the collection of parts. These are referred to
as emergent properties. When connections are found between modules it can lead to the identification of networks. Once networks
are identified, Systems Biologists seek to determine how the networks function. <br>
Systems Biology also seeks to understand the dynamics of networks in the sense of how networks become modified as cells alter
their states. A salient feature of Systems Biology is the tight integration of quantitative reasoning with biological
experimentation.
<br>
