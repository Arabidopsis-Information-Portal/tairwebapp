trap lines from Patrick Gallois</CENTER></H3>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>This population of 281 individual Gallois promoter trap lines was
donated by Patrick Gallois, Laboratoire de Physiologie et Biology
Moleculaire Vegetales, Universite de Perpignan, France. transgenic
promoter trap population which contains the promoterless pDGus Bin19
construct from Dr. Keith Lindsey; carries a Kanamycin resistance gene
and a promoterless GUS with its ATG next to the T-DNA left border;
plants of C24 were transformed by co-cultivation of root explants
with Agrobacterium tumefaciens followed by selection for on
Kanamycin; seeds were harvested from individual primary transformants
(T1); each progeny was germinated on Kanamycin and resistant
seedlings transferred to soil; distribution stocks are T3 or T4
generations bulked propagated from single primary transformants; more
than 50% of the lines express GUS in at least one tissue; these 281
lines have been screened for GUS expression in roots and for wavy
root mutations by P.H. Masson. </P>

<P>A general description of the lines may be found in: M. Devic, V.
Hecht, C. Berger, M. Delseny and P. Gallois (1995) - An assessment of
promoter trapping as a tool to study plant zygotic embryogenesis.
