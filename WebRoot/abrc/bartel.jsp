<P>A total of 33,100 T-DNA lines were generated using the 35SpBARN
vector via vacuum infiltration in the Columbia accession. The
35SpBARN vector contains Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CaMV) 35S promoter
which will drive plant expression of ligated cDNAs. In terra
selection of transformants can be conducted based on the gene
conferring resistance to glufosinate ammonium herbicide (BASTA). The
vector was ligated with a cDNA library prior to transformation of
plants, so that the T-DNA populations consists of individuals
transformed with different 35S-cDNA constructs. This construct should
allow phenotypes to be isolated that are based on overexpression or
occasionally cosuppression effects, in addition to the standard
loss-of-function knockout effects associated with T-DNA
insertions.</P>
