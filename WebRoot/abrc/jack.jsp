<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The Thomas Jack laboratory, Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, has
donated T-DNA lines and pools which were produced in a glabrous
Columbia background (Col-6, gl1-1). A modified vacuum infiltration
procedure was utilized to generate this material. The populations
were transformed with the pD991 vector which contains an enhancer
trap construct and a constitutively expressed NPTII/kanamycin
resistance gene between the T-DNA left and right borders. The
enhancer-trap construction is comprised of a bacterial uidA encoding
beta glucuronidase (GUS) flanked by -60 minimal Cauliflower Mosaic
Virus (CaMV) promoter segment and the 3' untranslated region of the
nopaline synthase gene (3' NOS).</P>

<P>The pD991 vector carrying the T-DNA enhancer trap was constructed
by cloning an Asp 718/BamHI fragment (carrying the -60 CaMV/GUS
fusion) from plasmid pD979 into Agrobacterium transformation vector
pCGN1547.</P>

<P>The distributed T-DNA pools are T4 seeds produced as follows. T1
plants were vacuum infiltrated with the Agrobacterium culture, and
the plants grown to maturity. The kanamycin resistant T2 seeds were
grown, 10 per pot, to maturity. Each resulting pool of T3 seeds was
harvested as a group and transmitted to ABRC. The only T-DNA lines
which were withheld from the donation were a small number having
specific GUS patterns in the inflorescence. No other selections were
conducted. Populations consisting of at least 400 T3 plants for each
pool of 10 lines were grown at ABRC, and the resulting T4 pools of
seeds were harvested and maintained as a single stock. &nbsp;</P>
