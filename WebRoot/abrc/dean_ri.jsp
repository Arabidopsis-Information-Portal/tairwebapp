<P>The bulked (F8) seeds we are distributing from the first 100 lines
were supplied to us by the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre. The
AFRC funded the commercial bulking of these lines. The second 200
lines were bulked at ABRC. Approximately 50 seeds will be supplied
per line, which should meet sampling requirements for correct RFLP
typing and provide enough tissue for direct analysis of the resulting
plants. If greater quantities are needed, please contact us.</P>

<P>These lines are the product of a cross between the ecotypes
Landsberg erecta and Columbia. Each line was subjected to self
fertilization by single-seed descent for eight generations. A total
of 300 RI lines were generated, all of which are now available from
ABRC.</P>

<P>RI lines can be used to map any trait which is polymorphic between
the parents of the lines (Landsberg erecta and Columbia). Initially,
66 RFLP markers and one phenotypic marker from the two previously
published RFLP maps (see references below: Chang et al and Nam etal)
were mapped using 100 of these lines. Hence, all new markers can be
mapped relative to these known markers.</P>

<P>Segregation data for the RI map is kept at <a href="http://arabidopsis.info/new_ri_map.html">NASC</a>. However, NASC no longer maintains (adds new markers) this map.The segregation data for the map (as of 2001) can be downloaded as a <a href="http://arabidopsis.info/RI_data/full_markers.text">text file</a> or downloaded as an <a href="http://arabidopsis.info/RI_data/full_markers.may2001.xls">Excel spreadsheet</a> from NASC.
