<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The following note, which describes the protocol employed to
generate the T-DNA pools and mutant lines, was transmitted to the
Arabidopsis newsgroup by Kenneth Feldmann.</P>

<P>To pool the transformed lines, approximately 20 seeds were taken
from each of 20 T3 families (F2 equivalent). The 400 seeds
representing these 20 transformants were grown in one 37 x 51 cm flat
(these will be referred to as a subpool). These plants were grown
under short day conditions such that maximum seed yield would be
achieved. 5,260 transformants, including the 460 transformants
generated at Zoecon in 1986-87, and 4,800 generated at Arizona in
1991, were grown in this manner. We generally harvested between
600,000-800,000 seeds from each of these flats (3,000-4,000
seeds/plant). However, for 23 flats for which the seed yield was low
or for which other difficulties arose, we were not able to distribute
seeds. To simplify the pooling process for the formation of the
size-100 pools, Randy Scholl and I decided to use the Zoecon subpools
to replace the missing subpools. In the cases where we substituted a
subpool it has been clearly indicated by the stock centers so that
anyone can ascertain the origin of a particular mutant.</P>

<P>Because we had ~5,000 transformed families to screen in the fall
of 1991, we invited several research groups to help with the work.
The following individuals have participated in the screening of
individual mutants: Embryo defectives: Dr. Robert Goldberg, Dr. John
Harada, and Dr. David Meinke; Flower: Drs. Elliot Meyerowitz and
Patricia Zambryski; Early development: Dr. June Medford; Reduced
fertility: Drs. Robert Fischer and Robert Goldberg. Most of the
mutant families identified by these researchers have been or are
being sent to the stock center at Ohio State as we get them retested.
These mutants will be made available through ABRC at Ohio State and
NASC.</P>

<P>There has been some concern about which mutants were included in
the pooling process. Several classes were, in fact, excluded. The
late flowering lines result in larger rosettes so we decided to keep
these out of the pools. However, all of these have been sent to the
stock centers. There were 7 primary dwarfs which my lab is
characterizing that were also excluded from the pools. However, the
vast majority of the &gt;800 putative mutants were included in the
pooling process. These include:</P>

<P>&gt;60 flower mutants &nbsp;&gt;60 reduced fertility mutants
&nbsp;&gt;150 embryo-defective mutants &nbsp;~150 size variants
&nbsp;&gt;50 seedling-lethals &nbsp;&gt;100 pigment mutants
&nbsp;&gt;100 other various morphological mutants.</P>

<P>The mutants listed above are available from ABRC. An additional
1600 pools were sent to ABRC in 1994.</P>

<P>All of these transformed lines are in the Wassilewskija (Ws)
background and all were generated with the 3850:1003 Ti plasmid. Note
that the Ws accession utilized for these experiments was maintained
for a number of generations in U. S. laboratories, and a stock of
this line is being made available through the stock centers. This
line should be considered distinct from the Ws of the Kranz
collection. This new population is described in more detail in the
following reference: Forsthoefel et al. (1992) Aust. J. Plant Phys.,
19:353-366.</P>
