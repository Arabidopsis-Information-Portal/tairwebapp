<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>This is a mapping population for tetrad analysis donated by Drs.
Daphne Preuss and Gregory Copenhaver. It is a backcross population of
the F1 of qrt1-1, Ler-0 (CS8845) by qrt1-2, Col-3 (CS8846) to ms1-1,
Ler-0; homozygous alleles of qrt1 were utilized in both parents to
produce F1 plants with pollen tetrads; the ms1 allele of the
backcross parent facilitated hybridizations; the backcross parent
resulted from crossing between ms1-1, Ler-0 (CS75) and gl1-1, Ler-0
(CS64); single pollen grains were isolated from tetrads and utilized
in separate pollinations; progeny plants were obtained and included
in the mapping population from at least three members of each tetrad
set; this mapping population consists of selfed progeny from 292
backcross families, 97 tetrads and 2 parental lines; there is
segregation within and among the lines for qrt1-1 vs. qrt1-2 and
er1-1 vs. ER; this population was used by the donors to map the
centromeres and analyze gene conversion.</P>
