<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>These activation tagged lines were obtained by transformation of
wild-type Columbia plants with the pSKI15 vector from D. Weigel. The
parental line (CS907) is included with this stock. The pools of this
set consist of varying numbers of lines. Sizes of pools range from
100-350 lines per pool, most having 300-350 lines. These pool sizes
represent the form in which the stocks were donated, and smaller pool
sizes are not available. The Weigel vector contains an activation
tagging sequence (multimerized CaMV 35S enhancers); also, pBsKS+
sequences allow plasmid rescue; plants are segregating for
phosphonothricin herbicide resistance (BAR driven by 5' MAS).</P>
